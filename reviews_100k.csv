"Wing sauce is like water. Pretty much a lot of butter and some hot sauce (franks red hot maybe).  The whole wings are good size and crispy, but for $1 a wing the sauce could be better. The hot and extra hot are about the same flavor/heat.  The fish sandwich is good and is a large portion, sides are decent."
"Owning a driving range inside the city limits is like a license to print money.  I don't think I ask much out of a driving range.  Decent mats, clean balls and accessible hours.  Hell you need even less people now with the advent of the machine that doles out the balls.  This place has none of them.  It is april and there are no grass tees yet.  BTW they opened for the season this week although it has been golfing weather for a month.  The mats look like the carpet at my 107 year old aunt Irene's house.  Worn and thread bare.  Let's talk about the hours.  This place is equipped with lights yet they only sell buckets of balls until 730.  It is still light out.  Finally lets you have the pit to hit into.  When I arrived I wasn't sure if this was a driving range or an excavation site for a mastodon or a strip mining operation.  There is no grass on the range. Just mud.  Makes it a good tool to figure out how far you actually are hitting the ball.  Oh, they are cash only also.Bottom line, this place sucks.  The best hope is that the owner sells it to someone that actually wants to make money and service golfers in Pittsburgh."
"This place is absolute garbage...  Half of the tees are not available, including all the grass tees.  It is cash only, and they sell the last bucket at 8, despite having lights.  And if you finish even a minute after 8, don't plan on getting a drink.  The vending machines are sold out (of course) and they sell drinks inside, but close the drawers at 8 on the dot.  There are weeds grown all over the place.  I noticed some sort of batting cage, but it looks like those are out of order as well.  Someone should buy this place and turn it into what it should be."
"My fiancÌ© upgraded his phone at the Apple store, but got a strange text on his new phone about his plan. We went over to the Verizon store to see what was up, and that was about as pleasant as having forks jammed in my eyes. Awful customer service. No one came up to ask us if we needed help. We had to tear a disgruntled man away from looking at his instagram feed to help us. He didn't say there would be a wait or to sit or anything, just said ""okay then"" and left us. So we stood there waiting for help or even just directions for far too long, were ignored and told him we were leaving. Awful awful awful customer service."
"Waited over 45 mins, 2 people ahead of me and I'm finally getting helped...  Wtf???I can understand them being busy but that was ridiculous.  I work out in Robinson and went to the Settlers Ridge location and BOY- WHAT A DIFFERENCE.  They were awesome.  In & out the door in 20 minutes- I ended up with a new 6s and my wife ordered a 6sPlus... All in less than 20 minutes!  I'll never go to this store anymore."
"Don't go here! This place is a scam. When it comes to opening, freezing, and canceling your membership it is not easy or convenient and they get every last penny from you for a mediocre gym with sweaty smelly locker rooms. Go to LA Fitness. Bad experience here."
"Used to go there for tires, brakes, etc.  Their prices have gone way up-$400 for 4 mid-level tires for a Toyota.  Plus, 1 of the new tires went flat within 3 weeks.  Since they don""t make appointments,  the wait to get the tire looked at was ~2 hours.  Sorry--can't wait that long to get a warranted repair,  They lost my business for good."
"I got 'new' tires from them and within two weeks got a flat. I took my car to a local mechanic to see if i could get the hole patched, but they said the reason I had a flat was because the previous patch had blown - WAIT, WHAT? I just got the tire and never needed to have it patched? This was supposed to be a new tire. I took the tire over to Flynn's and they told me that someone punctured my tire, then tried to patch it. So there are resentful tire slashers? I find that very unlikely. After arguing with the guy and telling him that his logic was far fetched he said he'd give me a new tire ""this time"". I will never go back to Flynn's b/c of the way this guy treated me and the simple fact that they gave me a used tire!"
"Terrible. Preordered my tires and when I arrived they couldn't find the order anywhere. Once we got through that process I waited over 2 hours for them to be put on... I was originally told it would take 30 mins. Slow, over priced, I'll go elsewhere next time."
"Last summer I had an appointment to get new tires and had to wait a super long time. I also went in this week for them to fix a minor problem with a tire they put on. They ""fixed"" it for free, and the very next morning I had the same issue. I called to complain, and the ""manager"" didn't even apologize!!! So frustrated. Never going back.  They seem overpriced, too."
"Don't waste your time.  We had two different people come to our house to give us estimates for a deck (one of them the OWNER).  Both times, we never heard from them.  Not a call, not the estimate, nothing."
"I can;t believe this place has a high rating. I had a bichon, who was seen here since his puppyhood and who was dying. I called to make an appointment to have him put down because he was in great pain. The receptionist would not give me an appointment until one week later, even though she could hear him crying out in pain. Anyway, he died in agony before his appointment. This was in 2010 and I have not taken my subsequent pets to the clinic."
"Never go to Rossi Tailoring and Dry Cleaners 393 Vanadium Road Pittsburgh, PA 15243. I decided to use a local business to do my dry cleaning. I dropped off 3 shirts at this establishment just before Thanksgiving. It is now late January. I have stopped by more than a half dozen times and have been given only ONE of the shirts. They have offered $20 a shirt for the shirts they lost. Those shirts are worth at least $50 each, and I refuse to take under $30 for each. I am tired of the run around, tired of promised phone calls that never happen (they have NEVER called me).  I wouldn't use their services again if you paid me to."
Station is closed.  Sign is blank and all fixtures from the store have been removed.
"Thomas DarbyI will never stay at this Extended Stay America due to the fact that we were there in October, 2015 and had an awful stay! Room was only cleaned one time after asking three times when it would be cleaned. There was absolutely nothing in the supposedly full kitchen, 2 wash clothes, 2 hand towels and 2 towels. We had to take used wash clothes and towels to front desk every day to receive fresh ones. The toilet ran over and the heater didn't work until we decided to leave. We were over charged after booking through Hotels.com and had to put up a $100.00 deposit. For what? Never again will we stay there!!!!!"
"If I could give this place less than one star, I would. I have no idea who gave this place high reviews but they must either own the place or be time travelers from back in the day when this place might not have sucked. The decor is tired and grimy, the place reeked of smoke, and the bartender/server was surly, to put it mildly. We went there on a Saturday night with a mind to try the Irish food. Apparently, we were out of luck. I've always thought that the secrets of restaurant success is to actually stock food for people to eat. He told us before we ordered that they had no ""pies"". No chicken pot pie, no shepherds pie, etc. So, we gamely tried to order other things. We placed our order. My wife, for example, ordered the Irish stew and he came back 5 min later telling us they were out of that and even more things for several people in our party. At that point my wife picked out a third option, ham and cabbage, only to be told again that ""they were out"". At that point, realizing that the only food to be had in the place was what was crusted on the menus, we asked to pay for our drinks and left. They actually then gave us flack for not having enough to put it on a debit card. In short, unless you like your dinner with a side of disappointment and depression, I'd probably avoid this place like the plague. Speaking of the plague, I suppose we should thank Mr. Surly for inspiring us to walk out. I only have two bathrooms at my house and would've been hard pressed to accommodate several violently ill people at once."
"The delivery driver mistakenly rang my doorbell, having confused 133 and 113.Rather than taking a step back and analyzing the situation, he begins to accuse my wife and I of ordering and refusing to pay for this pizza.The driver then gets on his cell phone and rather than calling the number than was given when the order was placed, begins to call his bosses and starts threatening me with felony charges. So I take the initiative and ask the fine upstanding gentleman what the phone number of the order-er was, phone my neighbor and discover the mistake. Rather than a thank you or a sorry, he just speeds off (breaking the speed limit on our block) to reach his destination 50 feet away.I would call to complain, but based on the other reviews, its clear the owners do not care about Carnegie or it's residents, and its pretty well known around town just how awful their food is, so it would be pointless to boycott a place I'd never order from again anyway.Do yourself a favor and order from ANY other establishment in town."
"Some of the worst pizza I've ever had.  We used a coupon from the paper for a 2 topping 8 cut Sicilian. First of all the pizza wasn't even cut through, and the sad attempt at cutting was so uneven that 4 of the slices were about an inch wide, while the others were about 4"" each. The toppings were scarce, they used mini pepperoni and put maybe 8 on the whole pizza. The onions were huge chunks and the mushrooms were straight from a can. The worst part though was the thick doughy crust that tasted more like a fishy sourdough roll. I'm serious... It was so noticeable that it made me wonder if the dough was bad or if they for some weird reason put fish sauce in it. It was gross. We also ordered steak and Italian hoagies. The veggies were old and wilted, and there was no dressing on either. The Italian had deli meat that was clearly bottom of the line and not very generous. The ""steak"" (if you an call it that) was greyish instead of brown and looked like it was a processed meat chopped into pieces. No flavor or seasoning and the texture was reminiscent of spam. It was so bad that I only ate 1/4 of it and tossed the rest. I have ordered from here in the past and always been disappointed. I thought I would give them another try since I'd never ordered a Sicilian pizza from there. What a mistake. I will never order from them again!"
"Unprofessional!  We ended up here due to being recommended by the insurance company. It WAS my fault for leaving an iPod in the vehicle, but regardless it was stolen. The owner would not take responsibility for the theft, and firmly stood by his employees. He did say that the cars are occasionally left unlocked outside the building. BAD PRACTICE!  Nonetheless, I am out an iPod, and he is out everyone's business that asks me for a recommendation for auto repair. LOCK THE CARS!"
"I'm an elite Yelp member and I try to say positive on all local businesses. That being said I can positively say stay away from this body shop. I was with Nationwide at the time of my front end accident and they told me to go here because they were part of their ""blue ribbon"" program. In my eyes this meant that this shop had clout and were a reputable shop. What I didn't realize this meant was that nationwide would basically get substantial discounts in return for them sending most of their bodyshop repairs this way. The owner and his wife run the shop. My accident happened in 2011. I called them and they told me to bring it in. They took pics and then sent me on my way. Told me it would take about a week to get the bumper, side fenders and new hood in. They would repaint and reattach. They also ordered new headlights.Showed up a week later. The only positive aspect was they took pics which were available online to show the progress of the car throught the week.After a week I picked it up. It looked okay. He never replaced the undertray which was damaged in the accident which would lead to problems down the road. He also forgot to cover the back of the car which got some overspray from the primer (How this happened when he painted the front of the car is beyond me. I'm assuming they were painting a car next to mine.)Here is where I am dissapointed with his service. After a week the bumper started falling off. Also the new headlight he put in started getting condensation in it which proved to me he never actually replaced it. I called and tried to set up an appointment but none of my messages were answered. After getting him on the phone he told me I needed to set up an appointment to come look at it. I showed up and he told me it would take more money to fix! Are you kidding me? The insurance company and I coughed up $6k so you could partially put it back together and then not want to fix it once it was falling apart? He told me I must have hit a curb and knocked the bumper off. He would not take responsibility for his lack of quality work. DO NOT GO HERE. I complained to Nationwide to remove them from their repair shop list but my complaints went unheard.I ended up going private party to redo his shotty work."
By far the worst most unprofessional dentist I have ever experienced her staff is too busy watching soap operas on all the TVs in each room instead of cleaning and she gave me a filling which was too deep which could have been understandable as her son had his pictures delivered from Hawaii and she had to stop 3 times to pay for them and show her whole staff all of them must be nice to have a 14 year old go to Hawaii on her moms dime and have her patience wait to see all of this happen I had to have oral surgery and have the tooth removed because she put the filling in too deep an abscessed tooth was the result I wouldn't recommend her to an ex girlfriend or someone I hate because of the three months of extreme tooth pain I had to deal with because of her lack of care and follow through even after I called and asked them for advice and follow up they simply could care less and did not even offer to reschedule an appointment other than prescribing me vicodin and antibiotics do not recommend and do not go to her license should be pulled!!
"In all fairness - I did not see this dentist but did schedule an appointment and waited 15 minutes for them to open.When I look at Yelp reviews, I usually weed out the outliers (the best and the worst).   Unfortunately, there are only two reviews.It was my first time at the office.   The office admin (very nice) asked for me to come early (before 9am) to complete paperwork.   I arrived at 8:50.    I waited.   I watched 2 employees walk by me (unlocked the door and re-locked it).    They did not acknowledge me.The door I was at had signage (open hours).    I decided to leave because of a review where the staff seemed distracted or disinterested in my presence.The office admin (very nice) called me to inform I am missing my appointment.   I explained to her that there were too many indications where this was not going to be a good fit and wished her the best of luck.I recommend if you see this dentist you go to the front door (furthest away from the parking lot) for the entrance.Poor recommendation because the staff who walked by me seemed to be distracted which was pointed out in a previous review."
"I've been to this office a good amount of times.  Each time the receptionists give of a vibe of entitlement and it is very uncomfortable.  Dr. Weinberg herself is very nice, but I doubt her ability. Every procedure she has done to my teeth has backfired. The third and last issue I have is that i always paid cash at the end of my visits and somehow I have received an invoice for $55. I called and of course the receptionist was sassy and rude so I gave up. Will never go back or refer anyone else"
Take it from me; avoid this place at all cost.  The only time I go is when I am starved and don't have the energy to cook or get edible food.  And then after I have been kicking myself.
I use to order here fairly often.  The past 2 years their food has been getting progressively worse every time I order.  It doesn't help that the owner that always is at the register is so rude to me every time.  I finally decided that I'm done.  I don't think I should feel let an inconvenience when ordering food from a restaurant.  Let alone one that the food isn't even that good. Also the inside is dirty as heck.  They can deliver food in a BMW but they can't buy a scrub brush?  I have found Golden Dragon in Collier Square is 100 times better then Don Don.
"They gladly have you come in for a ""consultation""/ cleaning just to tell you they work on children, but when you try to get actual work done on your child they all the sudden refer you to children's. Good scam to get that cleaning visit from patients but don't do any work. I will be looking for a dentist for all 3 of my boys that actually works."
"I spoke to a man this morning about the ice covered parking lot and sidewalk, as a business is liable to their customers if someone was to slip and fall due to negligence on the business's part. He told me good luck and that I'm liable to just be careful because everywhere is icy. After two years at this gym I'm fed up with the way they treat their customers. He told me he was fed up with me since I gave him a hard time about being out of towels a few weeks ago (which they've had towels since then). They never clean the parking lot in the winter so make sure you wear boots outside and don't crash your car. Aside from that, this gym is well just that a gym. My biggest critic (aside from rude management and negligence) would have to be that they don't encourage sanitization outside of the cardio room. There aren't towels and spray around the weight machines, which I've never had an issue with, but I'd hate to see that happen. I always make sure to at least wipe off my sweat marks from the machine, cause well that'd be pretty nasty. It is pretty large in terms of size and space to do anything aside from the ordinary weights and cardio. The workers well they're mostly young and don't really care too much (the man who told me I was wrong was older and possibly a manager or owner). They tend to not keep on top of the wash with the towels even when it isn't busy, which can be pretty annoying. Their cardio room always has Fox News on two tvs and then the middle TV has sports center on regardless of what else is on tv. They recently haven't even been putting pens games and stuff on. Must be too busy watching the 52 inch screen they have in the lobby for the workers while the cardio room has max 32 in the middle and 24 on the sides probably. If I had to pay full price for my membership I probably wouldn't belong here, but it's through my insurance. That said I don't swipe my card like most people in the front on my own. The machine is behind the counter. One guy always shows me how to do it myself, which was helpful the first time cause people aren't always around the front desk. That said when he is standing behind there chatting I would expect him to do it since it's his job. This gym is nothing state of the art fancy fancy, but do you really need a fancy looking gym? Their cardio room is pretty massive and even at peak hours I've never had a problem getting a treadmill or elliptical. They actually even have two hellix trainers, which aren't super common yet. Sometimes when things go out of order they take a while to fix them. I've run into the owner or manager one time in the bathroom when someone let a sink over floor and asked if I should tell the guys at the desk and she said oh no they're useless. This gym makes a killing from a) classes b) it's convenient and c) their personal training is a separate company (warrior fitness). I've been meaning to sign up for a trainer and I always see them busy. They all seem awesome and very helpful and challenging. Not sure if they have a separate yelp page, but I would say from what I've seen they'd bust your ass for sure!"
"Terrible service.  Food unremarkable.  Waiter disappeared for 45 minutes to serve larger group due to staffing mismanagement.  Saved his tip by discounting meal after I complained.  All and all, a very crude and unpleasant dining experience for me and my guests.  Not to be repeated, never again!"
"I have been to this restaurant twice and was disappointed both times. I won't go back. The first time we were there almost 3 hours. It took forever to order and then forever for our food to come and the place was empty. When I complained the manager was very rude and tried to blame us for taking to long to order. It made no sense, how could we order when the waitress wasn't coming to the table? After arguing with me he ended up taking $6 off of our $200+ bill. Ridiculous. If it were up to me I would have never returned. Unfortunately my family decided to go here again tonight. Again it took a long time to get our food. My food was cold and bland, my kids food was cold. My husbands salmon was burnt to a crisp and my sister in law took one bite of her trout and refused to eat any more because she claims it was so disgusting. The wedding soup and bread were good, but that's it! My drink sat empty throughout my meal and never got refilled even when I asked. Bad food, slow service and rude managers. I'll pass on this place if my family decides to go again. Not worth it at all with all the other good Italian options around."
"We stopped at Papa J's last Friday night (8/1) for a round of drinks. There were 7 of us altogether and we had eaten at another restaurant earlier in the evening.  One member of our party walked up to the bar to let them know we were sitting on the couches along the wall, as it was fairly busy that night. In the short time that he was there, a man who was behind the bar looked at him and then turn away without saying a word or notifying anyone else. He then turned to a waitress who had approached the service area of the bar and asked her if  we could have a server take our drink order. She said ""yep"" and then abruptly turned and walked away. At that point, he asked to see the manager  who came a few minutes later. When my friend told him of what had occurred, the manager said ""What do you want me to do""?My friend said ""An apology would be a good start"" whereupon the manager looked back at him and said ""Get out and don't come back"" ???????? Are you kidding????My friend is well traveled and frequently stays at higher end hotels and dines at quality restaurants. He was not screaming or belligerent in any way, shape, or form; simply informing the manager of what had occurred. That being said, we left and went back to 131 East, where we had previously eaten. The service there was fabulous, as was the meal and the drinks creative and exquisite.There are new restaurants that have opened in Carnegie as of late. Papa J's is no longer the only game in town.  Obviously this is the way a simple complaint is handled by management. Appalling!!  Do yourself a favor and frequent any of the other restaurants that are within walking distance of Papa J's. They understand the concept of  customer service."
Food was NOT GOOD at all! My husband & I ate here a couple weeks ago for the first time. I ordered a salad & basil pesto cream pasta & my husband ordered the spinach & feta pasta. The salad was just a huge plate of spring mix (nothing else in it) with WAY to much vinegar dressing. My lettuce was drowning in the vinegar. My pesto pasta had no flavor (did not taste like a cream sauce to me) & the pesto was so runny/watery & way too much sauce not enough noodles. My husband's pasta had even less flavor than mine. We ate about a quarter of the food & couldn't even finish it. We took it home & it was so bad I didn't even eat my leftovers. And I hate wasting food!! Plus the prices are expensive for the amount of food you get & of course the poor quality. Don't waste your time eating here. There are much better Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh.
"Had dinner with a friend. My friend ordered veal and they brought him sausage. The waitress was extremely rude. He never did get the correct meal. When We talked to the manager, his answer  was .,""well what do you want me to do fire the waitress?"" Too many good restaurants in that area to tolerate bad attitude!"
"We visited on 11/15 with a party of 15.  While I know a party of 15 can be overwhelming, we did call in advance for reservations. Thus, allowing proper staffing. We arrived early and headed to the bar. The bartender there greeted us quickly and took great care of us. When it was time for our reservation we were seated immediately. That is where the efficiency and service took a turn for the worst. We sat for 20 minutes before a server came to our table. At that point, she said I'll grab you water and bread.  Another 10 minutes go by and members of our party went to the bar to grab drinks as the server vanished (still no water or bread). She finally comes back to the table with bread (no waters) and takes our drink orders (about 40 mins into sitting at the table). Next thing we know, a nice gentleman by the name of Patrick is our NEW server. He really stepped up the service and should be commended. However, we ordered the veal stuffed banana peppers which arrived cold. We also ordered the ""incredible white pizza"" which was incredibly cold. While Patrick stepped up the service the entire experience was fairly terrible.Not once did the front of house manager come check on us. This is the second time I've visited and the 2nd time I've been disappointed.Also, I wrote to the restaurant and received no response."
"I've never posted a yelp review before.  This meal was so horrible that I downloaded the yelp app just so I could warn others to stay away!  We ordered food from Capri since we were going to voodoo brewery.  We ordered a cheesesteak with no mayo and an Italian calzone since the person working there talked up the calzones.  We ended up with a cheesesteak heavy on the mayo and an Italian wedgie, which was just a folded up pizza full of mayo and onions.  No sign of Italian meat to be found.  No marinara sauce.  It was inedible.  We ended up walking to kfc instead.  I want to leave a zero star rating, but yelp won't let me.  So they get an undeserved star."
"Any time Ive ever stepped in to Randys, there is a very odd smell that immediately makes me want to turn around and walk out. Bartenders dont seem friendly and if you arent a regular, expect to get weird vibes from the regulars.With all of the other options in the area, take your money elsewhere!"
"You would think their exorbitant prices would at least buy some decent customer service. Not at this location. They are totally understaffed and have almost nobody able or willing to help you find anything. This is a problem because they carry so many completely different products that it's hard to find what you need. Expect to wait at least a half hour before getting assistance.The organization is disjointed, especially depending on your project. There's even a section called ""art supplies"". I thought that was kind of the point of the whole store. What did it in however was how miserably they packed my picture frames. The place next door wrapped two dollar drinking glasses in paper to protect them, but apparently Michael's thinks a grocery bag is sufficient to protect a nice picture frame in bad weather. So, the inevitable happened and I dropped the bag. Now I don't expect every place to be sympathetic, even though it could have been packed better, but when I asked for a refund they were down right RUDE. Hey I did drop the thing, but some empathy would have been nice. I wasn't completely out of line asking because a little bubble wrap and it would have been fine in the first place. I will never be back to this or any other Michael's."
"This is the absolute WORST Steak N Shake I've ever been to. The bf and I got lost around Pittsburgh for 40 min. trying to find this location and on top of the unnecessary 1 hour wait for our food, the food itself was just so crappily made. It was so bad and we had waited a ridiculous amount of time (c'mon, Steak N Shake is basically a glorified McD's), our waiter comped our WHOLE MEAL.If not for the compensation, I would have been pissed that we had to pay for such a crappy meal. The bf, on the other hand, was more upset about the principle of the matter... we had trekked all that way just to get our Steak N Shake fix (since both of us haven't had it since our undergraduate days) and it was a major fail.I think I'm good with my Steak N Shake craving for a long time now...PS. The whole joint smells like major B.O."
"I went here at 3 PM between the lunch rush and the dinner rush, and the restaurant was maybe 20% full. I ordered the Chili Mac Supreme to go. I thought I would be in and out within 5-10 minutes. Keep in mind that this restaurant even has a drive-thru; the expectation is quick service.Long story short, my food never came... the waitress told me (after I had been sitting there waiting for thirty minutes) that the kitchen hadn't even started on my order yet, so I told her to cancel it and walked out. Now I see that others on Yelp have warned about the slow service at this location. Wish I had looked it up earlier."
The only thing worse than the food is the service.
"This was the most horrible experience at a restaurant I have had in years!!!!!!!!!!!!I was there at around 9pm, with about 9 folks from my family (visiting relatives included). There were several things that got me annoyed, one after another. I was ok that it took a while for us to be seated. But after we ordered, what really got me angry was that the food took a VERY long time to arrive. We had 2 kids with us and we ordered 2 kids meals, and had asked for those to be brought sooner. After about 25-30 minutes of nothing, I went to the servers (who were just NOT paying attention to us anyway - the main server's name for our table was Angel) and asked where our meals were. One checked with another, who then informed me that they were working on it. What made me even angrier is that they tried to downplay everything, telling me that it had only been 5 minutes. Then one of the servers (manager?) tells me that ""ok, may be it's been 10 minutes, but it's coming"". Then I hear some of the servers talking about our orders. The same gentleman then came to our table, sat down next to me and told me that it's only been 10 minutes and that they were working on our order, and tried to give me some explanation about why that's not really a long time at all. It was clearly almost half an hour or longer by that time. The food finally arrived about 10 minutes after that. But the food came cold. We were so HUNGRY by that point, we just ate whatever we could. Neither Angel nor anyone else came to top up our drinks even ONCE. I had to ask for mine, but by that point I was in no mood to take a sip even. I paid ($58.20) and I again got the same gentleman who tried (again!) to explain to me that it was just 10 minutes, and that ""given everything, we were within normal limits"". Wow. After about an hour and half at the restaurant, we all just shook our heads and left. I have written to them on their website, and will see if they follow up. We have vowed NEVER to go to this restaurant again. Yikes!!"
"Terrible wait staff  couldn't even seat us. Before we, and another party walked out without even being greeted properly, I observed several employees traipse out the front door, several tables who were waiting for their food for a long time,  several employees just standing around out of direct view of the tables, a morbidly obese hostess that could barely physically walk from one end of the store to the other. I think one server was high.     Going there was a  special request by a 7 year old getting over a long-ish illness, so that makes the shabby treatment more enraging."
"Food is good, what you'd expect from Steak n Shake. THE SERVICE IS AWFUL. so incredibly awful. expect to take at least an hour for your meal, even when it's slow. I've been going here for years when I want a cheap meal, but the service is so so so awful. Go to McDonalds."
"The service was fast but the food was terrible and so was the service. I had a bus to catch so I couldn't wait around waiting for the check so I went to the counter to pay. She never brought my check, never checked to see if my drink needed refilled, she just mopped the floors. The burger was really greasy, the fries were Luke warm and the cheese on them wasn't as flavorful as it should be. As a new Pittsburgher I'm not impressed."
"I should have known better than to stop here, but I was nursing a hangover and just wanted something quick and simple.  I should kick myself for thinking of this place.Granted I decided to go to the drive thru and knew there would be a wait.  The sign actually says that the food is prepared when you order it.  I sat for almost ten minutes at the window while my food was prepared.  During that time I wished I could have taken back my order and also wished that I hadn't paid already.  While sitting at the window I decided to just stare inside and watch some of the employees doing their job.  What disturbed me the most was watching the employee making the milkshakes.  Making a milkshake isn't that hard or glamorous of a thing to watch.  What disgusted me was that the guy actually lifted several of the containers for the milkshakes and smelt them.  I mean smelt them to see if they were clean, instead of actually taking the extra minute or two to clean the container.  After witnessing this my food was finally ready and I drove away.When I finally got to eating my food I was underwhelmed.  The fries had no flavor and with the size of the cut it appears you get more than what you ordered.  The ""steakburger"" really, they should just call it a burger, was overpowered by the BBQ sauce on it.  It was all I could taste.All this has cemented me in not wanting to ever step foot in one of these establishments ever again."
"You know what you're getting with a Steak N Shake: it's about one rung up from a McD's in quality, and about two rungs down in quickness. At least, you think you know. I used to have a small place in my heart (though the salt and fat weren't very kind to said organ) for Steak N Shake, because hey, who can argue with beef and drinkable ice cream? But after my last trip, I can think of nothing more disgusting than having to eat here, this location in particular. I haven't been back in over year, and I will never step foot into a Steak N Shake as long as I have an immune system that I care about. After having eaten here, I hit the restroom on my way out (along with my two friends....hey, we're girls, it's acceptable!). One stall was already taken, so two of us are stuck waiting while this occupant does her....shall we say, business? After a few seconds, we realize that she's not only there to relieve herself, but to also take drive-through orders. Yes, that's right....""You want fries with that? *flush* Okay, that will be $5.50"". I have never, ever witnessed anything so insane as a drive-through restroom. To top it off, after finishing her ""bathroom break"", she walks straight out of the stall and into the restaurant. I guess she was in too much of a rush to complete the order she had just taken that she didn't have time to wash her hands. And I was in too much of a rush to choke back up what I had just eaten before it wreaked mayhem on my stomach."
"I love Steak N Shake. This one, however, leaves a lot to be desired. The food often comes out cold and the servers are apathetic at best. Most of the time, they're downright rude. I highly recommend avoiding this location if possible. There's one on Route 51 that's worth the 15 minutes it'll take you to get there."
I like the occasional steak and shake stop.....    but this one has to be the slowest one ever.    The cashier was rude and I could hear her yelling are you fucking kidding me because the register was not working the way she wanted....     wow.... just wow...
"Every time we come here the service is laughably bad. On this visit a tabe which was sat after us had their food before our server graced us with her surly presence. Good restaurant elsewhere, just avoid this location if you want to get your food inside an hour."
"Wow. Dirty and slow.  The floors felt like they had the days burger grease spilled all over, and it took 30 m8n to get our take out order."
"The staff is very rude at the drive thru to the point of telling me at 2:02 pm ""It's only 1:59 you can't do the happy hour shakes yet!""   She literally screamed it at me.   The management does not enforce any kind of health code in that restaurant either.   I too, have witnessed employees not washing hands, and I have gotten food poisoning twice from undercooked burgers.   Once - shame on you, Twice - shame on me - won't go there again.     The lovely occaisional drug deal out in the parking lot at night doesn't help either when you have kids."
"This location is terrible. The drive-thru workers are rude and they give you crap food. I waited 5 minutes before being able to order, even when there was only 1 car ahead of me. Then the lady proceeded to ask me if I would like anything on my burger, and (thinking the pictures on the menu are what they're supposed to look like and they would never false advertise) I asked ""doesn't it come with the fixings like in the picture?"" she then told me it only comes with cheese. So I then went on to tell her what I wanted on my burger. Pulled around and got my order pretty quick, but later when I open my burger its just meat and cheese. The meat is badly burned and cold. It was clear to me this burger was not fresh. I didn't even attempt to eat it, what a waste of a place. They definitely need better workers."
"Awful in every category. The service is the worst I've ever seen. We were waiting to be seated in this half empty restaurant for 5 minutes before the manager came over and seated one couple. Then with more people waiting he went to the counter and took out a rag and started wiping it down. We were still being ignore until I told him it was alright we didn't need a table and left. I don't know how corporate keeps this place open. I've complained numerous times but it never does any good.Take the extra 20 minutes to drive to the South Hills location. Its pretty much the exact opposite of the Waterfront. The food comes out hot and properly cooked and you are not ignored by the staff."
"I really don't know how this place stays open. I've been here a couple of times. The service is slooooow. They bring you your food which is never the way you ordered it, put your Bill on the table and never come back to check on you. If the place was packed I could understand but it's usually about half full. On our last visit it took us 10 minutes to get our waitresses attention. We asked for some mustard, mayo, lettuce, and tomatoes for our burgers. It took 5 minutes to get the mustard and mayo. The lettuce and tomato never came. It's safe to say that we won't be back. We like the food and shakes but not worth it to put up with the poor service."
"If could give toys cunt of a human being ""Sue"" a manager negative 1,000,000 negative stars I would. Now I own a business so I understand Management. This stupid asshole from the second I walked in the door disrespected me , talked down to me, then refused me Service. From the ""why do you want(with accompanied eye roll) "" For no other reason than ""she was doin five people's jobs"" ...I do five people's jobs sometimes and that's no excuse for how she treated , and it's treating me as I write this in front of her. She just threw my receipt at me, rang me out, and threw my Change in my hand. Then threw away my receipt so it would be harder for me to contact corporate. I didn't pick her job. If she hates it so bad being responsible for other ppl, then maybe her smart fucking Ass should pick a new career. I will make it my life's mission to get her fired for this. Because I'm pretty sure the camera don't lie. (Middle finger)"
"The hostess (Jenn of Jess, I'm not sure) is atrocious. I am autistic and asked to be moved from right beside the kitchen because of noise levels, and she made a huge deal of it. I ended up crying outside waiting for my partner to let me know we'd been moved. 15 minutes later, we had still not been moved or gotten food, and my partner and I left. This is 1:45 PM on a Thursday. Not at all busy. Just bad service. Our waitress was very polite, though."
I have eaten here before and never had any problems. But today was completely different. I arrived 12:15 PM to have lunch with my family. We sat there for about 25 minutes and not one person came to ask us if we were ready to order. They completely ignored us so we got up and left. One table near us had to flag a waitress just to get her attention. So we went to  Wendy's up on 8th Avenue and we had no problems ar all.
I know service speed isn't a chain-wide issue. This place is just REALLY. SLOW. We ordered 40 minutes ago. Still no food.
He was incredibly sexist/homophobic. He could barely play the piano and when we finally recognized a song we could actually dance to he literally asked me to get off stage because he didn't like another on stage who could actually dance with the girls.
"Entertainment Great! Bartenders can be asses! Ordered 2 beers & 2 jaegerbombs, total was $23, second round of same with an asshole bartender was $27 then the third of the same was $25? What a damn ripoff!"
I didn't like the customer service of this body shop.. There price estimate for my repair was outrageous.. They won't be getting my business
I've gotten a few more estimates since I wrote my original review.. I found that Joe Dilorio's repair estimate was three times the price of the other auto body shops.. If you don't believe me= check yourself..
"When making a Customer's paymento atLowe's, we have our checklist:1. Do the phone numbers match?  Nope, but that's fine since people are always changing their phone numbers anyways.2. Does the name on account match name on check?  Nope, but mistakes happen at those pesky check companies.3. Does the account number on the check match the account number on the screen?  Why should it, those computers are always making mistakes.Now that we have verified that all the information is correct, we can process the payment.  The customer will be so happy that we didn't have to bother them with any silly questions.******I am sad to say that this is an actual occurrence.  What was originally an average Lowe's has turned into Lowe's Hell.  If the associates do not have basic logic comprehension, how do they survive?"
"Would like to give NO STARS.  bought all new kitchen appliances there.  Refrigerator is defective.  Theysend an outside company to repair.  Man arrives with NO TOOLS and wrong size seal for freezer.  not once, twice.  The first time, he tries to use my spoon from counter to install it!  I complain, too bad...they have to comeTHREE times before replacing it!  NEVER AGAIN."
"Before today I probably would have given this place three stars based mostly on their beer selection; however, today the service was terrible. We waited two hours for a pizza sub, French onion soup, fries, and buffalo chicken tenders. About an hour and a half in we finally got the small pizza sub and the wrongly made buffalo chicken tenders (ie, no hot sauce). We were told by the waitress that she realized it was wrong, but decided to still bring it out to see if my gf would eat it. She sent it back. By a half hour later, we still had not received the buffalo chicken tenders, nor the French onion soup (which should have been mostly made already), and no fries.  We were told the chef was new, but no effort was made really to make the situation better. No quick and easy app or beers on the house. To boot, the beer was pretty expensive. I will probably give the place another chance based on their beer selection, but it won't be for a while. The food has always been average at best, and the pizza sub was no different. We ended up leaving after two hours without receiving 75% of our order."
"The food was absolutely gross! I ordered a turkey club which comes on a wheat bun with avocado, bacon, and turkey breast. What I got was TOTALLY different from the picture! First of all the sandwich was on sliced bread (lame)! There was no avocado, 1 slice of bacon, no lettuce, and to TOP it off instead of turkey breast they used freaking LUNCH MEAT! lol No, not the kind that you get from the deli, the other sweaty nasty looking stuff! Gross! Our waitress was awful but they were extremely understaffed so I would have a bit of an attitude if I had to wait 10 tables without assistance too.   The manager was really nice... Of course that disgusting sandwich that I didn't eat was free."
Mediocre service. COLD food! Our food waited so long the lettuce & pickles wilted. Bland food. Crazy overpriced. Long waits in the arcade. 1 beer per hour maximum.  Avoid at all costs. Fair manager.
"This place just plain sucksBad management lost them bizDumb arcade drama** they have recently changed their under 21 policy so no one underage can even be in the arcade or restaurant after 10pm despite having a guardian over 30 years old"
"Visited the Dave and Busters in Homestead, PA last night. Waitress mixed up our credit cards and gave my brothers credit card to someone else and he theirs. Charged them already too - both incorrectly My brother had to walk around and find out who it was. Waitress never apologized. GM was extremely rude and refused to give my brother his original receipt back saying they had thrown it out. DID NOTHING TO REMEDY the situation and ignored us the rest of our visit - not even a refill. After spending over $300 plus games, we will never go back. Whatever happened to the customer is always right? HORRIBLE service"
"Most of the games were out of order and I had to find one of those referee looking people to fix 2 of them that took some of our credits.  Apathetic service staff all around, the Peanut and I were really disappointed.  Won't be back."
"To keep it short and sweet: Save yourself $100. Buy a good board game, your alcohol of choice, order a pizza, and invite your friends over. What an incredible disappointment. After seeing the enticing commercials so many times, we decided to give this place a try on a double date. I understand the prices of the play cards and won't dispute them; however, the food was incredibly over-priced, came out COLD (as in, sat on a counter without warmers for a minimum of 30 minutes) and I literally had to ask the bartender if there was any vodka in my drink. It was pure juice. $38 for three shots that had little-no alcohol in them. (Not to mention, my glass was dirty, and I saw the bartender scoop the glass into the ice basin because she was too lazy to use the sanitary scoop. I know the Food and Beverage Commission would be as disappointed as I was.) The service was terrible. Don't ask for anything from your waiter, as they are a little too busy on their cell phones or conversing amongst themselves. Was it fun to be in an adult-themed arcade? Yes. If you're looking for a good atmosphere to go with friends to play games, I suppose I would advise you give it a shot. I would never recommend their food, customer service, or drinks. Save yourself the money and stay home, or go for a traditional bowling, figure skating, roller-blading, rock climbing, basically any other physically-entertaining themed date instead."
"I was here on 10/3 and I have to say this was a horrible experience.  Me and a friend went here to eat and play a couple games afterwards.  It took the waitress at least 10-15 minutes to greet us and by that time we knew we should just order then because we might not see her again.  We ordered and got our drinks and well let's just say we didn't see the waitress again until she was giving us our check (some manager delivered the food to the table).  No refill on my beverage, no how is your food, no ketchup for my burger or fries was offered.  Lots of people running around like crazy and if your understaffed hire more people!  I will not be back again to eat."
"We checked in at 7:00 pm on a Saturday with a group of 19 for a birthday gathering.  We were originally told 9:00 pm is when we'd be seated, but that's not the problem, because we were able to play before being seated.  We ACTUALLY didn't get seated until 10:00 pm, only to be told the kitchen was taking 3 hours for people's orders.  Didn't see a manager until after 10:30 pm.  Needless to say, we didn't stay to eat and went elsewhere."
"Ok, we went on a sat night with a large party, 2 hour wait for a table. Fine that's understand then it turned to a three hour wait. Once seated we were told the kitchen was THREE HOURS behind and the wait for food would be three hours. The manger blamed us saying "" you came with a large party on a sat night, if you only order apps and not separate  meals, you MIGHT get food in 45 min"" really ? It's the customers fault your staff can't handle a sat night rush. The table of 5 next to us waited 3 hours for food, when they got it it was the WRONG food... I will never spend money here again!!!To top it off the bathroom had no toilet paper and there was pee everywhere!"
Awful awful. Spent 150.00SERVICE WAS TERRIBLE. Took 27 minutes to even be acknowledged. Really. The only saving grace was the kids had fun and the hostess took AMAZING care of us......
"The service at the Pittsburgh location was so incredible awful that I actually took the time out of my day to write online how disappointed I was, which I have never done before. It was a Saturday night and as someone who works in a restaurant im very sympathetic when it comes to service. We sat at the high tables in the bar area and we did not get greeted or even acknowledged for 30 minutes. I personally had to get a manager and explain to him the situation and he treated me like I was stupid (maybe because im 17?) Also not to mention the little girl next to me is balling her eyes out because she told her server of an egg allergy she has and they still managed to mess it up and give her food marinated in egg. Last I overhead they are heading to the hospital. I'm not writing this message to be spiteful, I'm writing it in hopes that the future of your restaurant will improve. There's a big difference between service and hospitality and right now this place is lacking both. My best wishing for improvement"
"Worst experience at a restaurant, waited 45 minutes for a waitress to come over and tell us that they changed a rule and that to eat in the game room you needed to be with someone over 25, when we had eaten there 2 days prior without any problems, when 2 of us are legally adults, will never go back to this place, I highly recommend red robin across the street."
"This wasn't the cleanest place. Dirty paper towels all over the women's bathroom. No changing covers on the changing tables to change your Babies. Very disappointed when I came here compared to the other two I've been too. Also they aren't following corporate policy. Which ok, but when I asked about it to one of the managers on the way out, he said he didn't honor the first responders discount like the other stores do. Which ok Is fine, but he had a very sore attitude towards them. Very disappointed in his attitude more then anything."
"Worst service I've ever had! we waited for over an hour for our food. After the waitress walked by 6 times without saying a word or refilling our drinks we got a manager who had her come by and apologize and give us a round but never said a word about our food. And told us her help never showed up. We waited another 30 mins for our food before we asked for the check for the 2 drinks we got. We left and nothing was even said about why we never got our food. No apologies nothing. While sitting there we noticed 2 other parties walked out as well. They didn't even get their drinks.I would recommend that if you go there never sit and eat. Drink play games fine. I will never order food there again."
Went to Dave and busters to eat.... NO FOOD. Went to Dave and busters to play.. NO GAMES. Then I thought I'd wet my whistle with a cool glass of H2O..they even RAN OUT OF WATER... Some lady even yelled at me in line to purchase game tickets accusing me of cutting line. SUCH HOSTILITY. dave and busters? More like BEAVIS & BUTTHEAD. SMH
"This is a place I'd go to just for the games. The food was bad. I had the chicken sliders and there was two pieces of wood in the sandwich which I found in my mouth. Granted the manager did take off the price of the sliders but everyone's fries were lukewarm. My sister got the chicken fingers and wow, there was zero flavor or seasoning on it. The bathrooms smelled like stale urine and the floors were very sticky. The waitress was nice but overall i wouldn't dine here again."
"This is the Wendys that made me never want to eat at Wendy's ever again.  To think I gave it a second a third and even a FOURTH try!  I guess convenience gets dollars but after so long, you'll stop getting mine.The employees here are always fighting when you go in about shift changed and duties and the attitude carries itself right over to the register.  The management isn't any better telling me to go somewhere else if I don't like it then.  This place is the reason people scoff at giving $15 a hr to fast food employees.  The frosty is never frosty always runny.  The burgers are slapped together and the dining room looks more like a daycare after a long day than a place you would want to sit down and eat.The only good thing about this place is the exit so you can swiftly leave and never come back."
"Tried going twice. Twice i got a "" were closed"" i said i thought you were open till 1? ""Nah"" it was 12. I thought Wendy's advertises that they're open until 1? Like thats their commercial campaign. Guess not. Cant rate the food cause i haven't received any. I would have loved to try. But since its 1210 guess they are closed. Don't worry Wendy's. Maybe you should add 100+ sodas to this location but don't worry i wont have any from this one or any. I am done w this franchise."
It took an hour to get our food when everyone else got their food in five minutes. They forgot two of our drinks and one of the employees said a cuss word infront of a child.
"If there was a way to give no stars I would. Horrible service. Was given a time frame or 45-50min for delivery, after waiting an hour we called and was told food was on the way they sent the delivery guy out with 6 orders. After another 30min we called back and was told pizza was still there because they ran out of part of our order. They said they'd bring it right away. Waited another 20min we live about 1.5 miles away from the place still nothing. So we called back and asked for our money back. They never once apologized and every phone call they were trying to talk to another person about a whole different matter. And oh since we used a card it's going to be 3-4 days to see the refund. At least pay cash so when they don't show you know you won't be ripped off at least."
If you want terrible pizza go here. Save money go buy a frozen pizza and it will be better than this place
"Horrible beer, horrible service, horrible menu"
My friends got everyhing from steak(they didn't even get a well done steak right) to mahi tacos and the only great menu item was the seasoned vegetables- give it a miss. Sing sing next door is awesome but get dinner somewere else. After we were done the waiter asked if we were ready for the checks and I had ordered meal that came with a desert! Really dissapointing all around.
For a brewery who is attempting to take advantage of Oktoberfest you wonder how at 7 pm they could be out of mashed potatoes & sauerkraut then a sausage platter with sweet mustard guess they have not been to Germany. Not worth $5.95 unfortunately the sausage platter was $15.95.
Came with my BF we started with the crab artichoke dip. It was very greasy and had virtually no crab. The wedge salad was good and crisp. I had the hazelnut crusted chicken. This has to be one of the worst dishes I've ever had it was like pancake syrup over breaded chicken. To finish the meal we had the homemade chocolate chip cookies served with hot fudge. Well there was no hot fudge it was chocolate syrup the ice cream was so crystallized from melting and re-freezing all around disappointing.
"Be careful. The servers can't pay attention to save their lives, and the management cares even less. I want to make sure people know how careless the management is, particularly Mark who seems to let his staff run around."
"Very disappointing menu. Pseudo Mexican and south of the border fare. I had the Beef Tip Sliders. What a ridicules offering. Each one (2 on a plate) had a nickel sized piece of beef on an oblong  3"" bun. It was taken back to the kitchen, after I complained, and a thin sliver now appeared. The only thing good about this experience, the waiter was nice!As the raven said, ""Never, never more."""
"Terrible customer service, disrespectful in fact. I towed my vehicle to Master Muffler in the evening. The owner called me at 645 am the next day and gave me attitude for leaving it in his parking lot. He told me he wouldn't work on the vehicle and that I had to pick it back up by the end of the day. I said this was a secondary vehicle and I asked if he could be fixed at his earliest convenience, he said ""it doesn't work like that"".  Never going back again  and I would advise against Master Muffler to all others."
"Went to see Bret Ernst (one of my fave Comedians).  Tickets say seating begins at 9pm for the 9:30pm show.  Well, a line had formed outside because they hadn't opened the doors.  That is all well and good if it is summertime but it was 4 degrees.  People stood out there upwards of 20 minutes, freezing.  They didn't let people in because they claimed the room was not ready.  Seating is first come, first served.  Whoever designed this place should be shot.  There is no lobby to hold people before a show.  The Improv in Cleveland is superb.  That location has a huge lobby and bar where you can mingle before the show and they have ushers seat you.  The Pittsburgh Improv is a disaster layout-wise.  Beverage service was fine.  It got really, really warm in the room and even the comedian was sweating like a freak show.  Of course Bret and Bill Crawford were as hilarious as ever but man, this Improv, as a comedy venue, sucks."
"In the market for unsalted cashews? How about oyster sauce? Ahhh, here's an easy one: bean sprouts?Well if you are, keep a crystal ball and rabbit's foot handy if you're planning on shopping at this Giant Eagle because you'll need both a soothsaying ability as well as a fair share of luck on your quest at this dive. For a store of this size, they are frequently out of stock on items as common as jalapeÌ±o peppers to specialty foods items like flat rice noodles. Maybe I'm the only person in Homestead buying these items...wait that doesn't make sense, they'd be in stock if I were!Do yourself a favor and either go to the Greenfield, Regent Square or Kennywood Giant Eagles. All three stores are much smaller but seem to stock rare items like unsalted (or as of late sea salted) Xochitl tortilla chips and Honey Nut Cheerios."
"This review is specifically for the DFS cleaners at this Giant Eagle location.  I dropped clothing off for the sake of convenience once (I really should have known better).  Never again.  My items came back completely covered in lint.  I could let this slide, however my pencil skirt was safety pinned to the hanger.  The weight of the skirt caused even larger holes than what were placed there by the pins.  Being that it's a pencil skirt designed to have a blouse tucked in, there's no way that I can wear it again.  This was an expensive skirt, completely ruined.  Very disappointed.  Again, this review is just for the dry cleaners.  The rest of the store is actually better than a lot of other GE's I've been to in Pittsburgh.  Just don't take your dry cleaning here."
"This is a review of the Pharmacy. After having them screw up a third time I felt that others should know that this is a pharmacy to avoid. The first time they misread a prescription and gave me the wrong dose of Synthroid, about 1/10th of what I needed. I ended up so sick after 2 weeks of taking too little that I was half dead before the problem was caught. Their response when I told them was to say ""oops"" and ""it won't happen again"". Not even a sorry, and it never did happen again b/c I went to Costco after that. This latest time was classic. I came with a simple scrip. Costco was closed so I went to Giant Eagle. After 45 minutes the finally inform me that they can't fill it b/c the scrip isn't specific enough (it was for a common antibiotic, nothing complicated). They didn't bother to call me earlier or tell me sooner, just made me wait and wait and wait until I pitched a fit to tell me that they couldn't fill it. It was late and I went to Rite Aid in Sq. Hill with the same exact scrip and they had ZERO issues filling it quickly. WTF? How can it be easy peasy at Rite Aid but Giant Eagle can't even muster the effort to tell me that they are too incompetent to fill it out? I wonder if there is even a legit pharmacist working there at all. It seems like they aren't even staffing the pharmacy with trained techs, just random people off of the street. Don't waste your time, or risk your health. Go to any other pharmacy in town, avoid Giant Eagle."
Went to Barnes and Noble Waterfront with 3 books on my list.       First one there were several books by the same name so they wanted the name of the author.  Went to look it up on my phone.....Barnes and Noble wifi had blocked me.  Wanted me to sign it and allow them access to my information....NOT.  Long story short they only had one of the 3 books I was looking for and it was $4 less on Amazon....Lost this customer.
"The words ""epic fail"" get thrown around a lot these days....but I really feel like they apply in this situation.We went on Friday, April 2 and arrived at 5:10pm.  It was busy, but not crowded....no waiting for a table.  Half price apps and drinks -- we ordered at 5:20.The food (just appetizers, mind you...) didn't arrive till almost 6pm.  Drinks were ordered and were unbelievably slow.  We placed one order for 6 draft beers at 6:15...they arrived at 6:52.  *37 minutes for beer.*By 7:00, we were canceling food orders which we'd given up on after waiting almost an hour.  We just wanted to leave.Instead of comping anything, they added 18% gratuity to each of our bills.  Uhhhh yeah.  Thanks for giving me one more reason never to come back.   We finally were able to leave around 7:30.Bar Louie:  You are dead to me."
"We were going to see a movie that started at 9:40pm. The 2 of us got to Bar Louie at 8:30.  We sat outside, and it was nearly 30 minutes before the waiter even stopped to get our order.  I tried stopping a waitress but was told 'this isn't my table'.  Finally the waiter took our order.  1 Sam Adams light bottle, and one Pineapple Juice+Vodka.  After about 15minutes another waiter (maybe the manager I don't know) asked if we had been waited on. We said yes, and told him we had been waiting.  He left, and another (different) waitress came to bring us our drinks.. they were wrong.. My date was given vodka on the rocks. and I was given a Sam Adams.. They took these back, and another 10 minutes before the correct order was served.. We told them to bring another round and the check.  It was 20 minutes before they returned.. and they forgot the check.By this time we had to go to be on time for the movie.. my date asked for the check again so we could leave.. finally they brought it and I gave him my card, when he came back we signed it and left in a hurry to catch the movie.for 2 bottle beers, and 2 pineapple juice + vodka I was charged $31.03. I didn't have time to complain or ask. I won't be going back."
"When the ratio to wait staff to diners is 3:1 you'd think you could get service!!!Nothing erks me more then seeing idol wait staff and hungry patrons. I very rarely walk out of a restaurant with out having eaten first. I came here on Saturday ay 6pm. Almost none of the diners had food on their table and many of them didn't have drinks in the 15 minutes I was there I counted 9 waitress again I counted 9 waitresses and not a one of them came over to our table to get even a drink order. Just from the looks of it I could tell staying any longer would be a total train wreck. So after 15 minutes of waitress counting we left with empty bellies."
"I was looking to get out of the apartment on a really nice, sunny day and we decided to drive to Waterfront and walk around. All around great day until we hit Bar Louie for some drinks and appetizers.I am giving it one star, though it deserves none, because our waitress was nice, if a bit inattentive, and the hummus app we ordered was pretty damn good. Outside of that Bar Louie leaves a lot to be desired.This is probably the first place I've been to where they charge $10 and up for all mixed drinks. To me, that is beyond ridiculous. Bar Louie is not an upscale restaurant, as much as they wish they were, and paying almost $60 for three drinks and two appetizers is insanity defined. As I mentioned the waitress was friendly, but she definitely did not come back and check on us enough. I really wanted to like this place because of things I had heard and the drinks we had were really damn good, but if it want to spend that kind of money, I'll go somewhere that I can get good service."
"I came here last night to get a few appetizers before a movie, and was hoping to be able to write a review on the food. Unfortunately, I cannot because the service was so bad that I left before I had the chance to order. We found seats at the bar behind the taps. After sitting there for 5 minutes and not being acknowledged, we thought that they might not be able to see us, and so we moved to a different pair of seats in the middle of the bar, grabbing a few menus on the way so we would be ready to order. It was fairly busy, but it is not like there were people standing at the bar trying to get drinks - everyone was seated and I'm sure they face much busier times. We sat in our new seats for almost 15 minutes (I timed it - I am not exaggerating), and were not even acknowledged. You would at least think the bartender would acknowledge us and tell us he would be with us when he could, but despite staring him down almost the whole time, we could not even make eye contact. I hope this is a fluke but will probably not be back to find out."
"The absolute worst service I have ever had at any bar or restaraunt.  And, in looking at other reviews, I am not the first.  There are many options at the Waterfront, and I would suggest you try any of them; but stay far away from this place!"
"Servers are chatting, not paying attention to tables. I can see my salad is ready at the window. Worst serves ever."
"Meh, I just don't see the appeal Bar Louis has to Pittsburghers. I guess this particular restaurant benefits from people who work at the Waterfront stopping in after a shift. It's always packed. Being so close to the AMC theater, they get traffic before and after movies. It's expensive, the food is so so. Before I get ahead of myself, I had the BBQ ranch chicken salad without chicken. The BBQ ranch dressing was very good, but it's very easy to duplicate at home. It's equal parts ranch dressing and KC Masterpiece hickory BBQ sauce and a drop or two of Worcestershire and a drop of franks hot sauce. Tuesday is dollar burgers 5 until midnight, daily drink and happy hour selections, but even that's not enough to get me here. Skip it. One caveat for this location, free parking. At Station Square's location you gotta pay to park the jalopy.I'm eager to see if this place sees a huge drop in business when Burgatory opens across the street."
"We stopped here to enjoy a drink before our movie. Our server, was friendly. My husband had a margarita and my server suggested a berry mojito to me.Both drinks were overly sweet and barely any alcohol.  After I finished my drink, I used my fork to dig for the blackberries at the bottom only to find (to my disgust), a decent sized piece of clear saran wrap! Ugg! Did they muddle the mint into the saran wrap?!!! She comped the drink but we won't be back.Can't speak about the food since we didn't have any but atmosphere was loud and it was difficult to have a conversation without repeating yourself."
"I can't even review this place. We sat ourselves and waited for a waitress to take our order, and we waited and waited until we got tired and just left. And I have to be clear it was a Saturday afternoon, maybe like 10 tables with people at them and I saw 3 waitress walking around. I think it's probably a bad idea to ignore people that come into your restaurant, especially since burgatory just opened across the street."
Well it's 9pm on a Tuesday and no tater tots. Dip for the chips are cold and beer is room temperature. Not very happy. Will try the station square bar Louie next time.
My friends and I went down to the waterfront to enjoy some shopping and have dinner. Everywhere was pretty busy so when we went into Bar Louie we were not upset it took at least ten minutes for a server to come to our table. He immediately brought our waters over and we ordered drinks. Only another 30 minutes until he brought ONE martini over. We ordered our food and after talking to management it still took 45 minutes and our order was messed up. We tried to be understanding when we learned it was only our servers first day but you would think that management would try to help the poor guy out! He didn't get out of the weeds for the 2 hours we were there. Very disappointing and embarrassing on managements part. We weren't the only people having horrible service because when we looked around the bar everyone was upset. I hope they will let the server get some more experience rather than feeding him to the wolves on the second day.
"Sign stated ""Seat Yourself"" so we should have know the service would be horrible from the moment we walked in.  We originally sat upstairs, which was open per the sign.  After 20 minutes we got up and went outside. After 20 minutes outside and after the waitress taking care of and making small talk with the table next to us, we said screw it and walked.  The one other time that I had been there the service was so-so.  I will never go back.  Why should I have to try to track people down to pay for a meal?!?"
"Should have checked the reviews before we went. I've been to ""real"" Bar Louie's in other cities. This is not one of them. Was seated for 20 min and no wait staff came to take our order. Several of them made eye contact but did not feel the need to ask if we had been waited on. Awkward. Then someone came over with two plates of food trying to serve us. We thought, here was our big chance to get served, but no, she just walked away. So we left. There are so many restaurants where you can get burgers, just go someplace else."
"Worst bar I have ever been to. They used maybe no alchohol in their drinks and consistency had no meaning here. We ordered three berry mojitos and they were different significantly. I posted a picture, you judge."
"I went with some work friends before catching a movie later that night.  We got to Bar Louie a little over 2 hours before the movie started, which left us with hardly any time to spare by the time we were done.  We had a table right away and the server took drink orders, but it took 15 minutes to get our drinks.  She then disappeared for 30 minutes before coming back to take a food order.  The food took almost an hour, and we had only ordered a couple appetizers.  The portions were really small for the price, and most of the food came out burnt.  I did not risk mentioning it at the thought of waiting another hour for new food.  Again, waiting for the server to bring the checks after the meal was an ordeal in itself and took much longer than it should have.  The place was busy, but not overcrowded, what I would expect on a typical weeknight.  There is no excuse for the poor service and food.  On top of that, the restrooms were extremely filthy and clearly had not been stocked or cleaned recently.  Maybe it was just an off night for this place, but I do not plan on going back again and taking that chance."
The worst bar and the worst service in the area. If I could give it 0 stars I would. There is not one positive thing I could say about any times Ive ever been here. It has now been added to my very short list of places I will never step foot in again. Please... Take your hard earned money elsewhere.
"Dont waste your time with this place.  Long lines, overpriced and no shade or cooling spots while you wait. Half the ""rides"" were shut down. You're better off with a garden hose. Save your money or buddy up to someone with a pool."
"Insanely expensive! $6 parking. $8 locker. $9 wrinkled, burnt hot dog. I really hate this place. Kids received season passes for Christmas present. Brought kids once and will never return. Spent $46 on food and threw most of it away"
Boo!  What happened to this location?  It used to be happy and fun!  It just feels depressing and nearly everyone there is just doing the bare minimum to get by?  So sad.
"Came here the other day for a late lunch with a friend. The place was pretty dead and we were seated right away. Took 30 minutes for our waiter to show up and we just order both drinks and food then. Took another 30 minutes to just get our drinks (2 beers on draft) and tables who were seated after us were served much faster then us. Finally our food came (soup, salad, boneless wings, and fries). A different server delivered the food and it looked like it had been sitting out for awhile. After being given our food we were completely ignored, along with others in our section. Us and two other tables waited over 45 minutes just to try and ask for our check (one table just got up and left!) Being a server myself, I try to be very understanding to the wait staff. But this was ridiculous, the restaurant was not even close to busy and my section of about 5-6 tables was ignored."
"Awful everything. From the bad service, to the diluted soup, to the lame-no chicken on the chicken salad, to the PRE-fabricated pizza. AVOID THIS PLACE!"
"Well, it started well. Food was okay. Deep dish pizza was good. But the salad we had - too tiny portion!!!We were greeted and seated well. But later the service was not all good. Bad bad service. First of all we had to ask for everything we wanted. The server didn't even had courtesy to ask if we wanted anything more or would like to go for deserts. She just handed over the check when we even didn't ask for it (we wanted to order more).Later when we talked about this in the front, the girl there also just listened and said ""okay"", not even a sorry once!!!I would not like to go there again... :("
"How does this place still exist of every place on the waterfront!  I won't lie, I do like their Lobster Bisque but every time I've gone it's just over priced, average quality with semi ok service.Skip this place all together and get pizza at Pizza Company and take it home."
"Possibly the worst overpriced pizza there is.  Nearly $20 for a pepperoni pizza for two would be okay if it were good.   Crust is extremely dry and unflavorful.If you want a good deep dish pizza, try Burghs Pizza and Wing pub in Bridgeville.   Their deep dish is thicker, tastier crust, better sauce, and a lot more cheese/toppings.   Cheaper too.Service was just barely adequate on this visit."
"Interesting the reviews here are less than stellar already. I would normally not review a chain retail store, but the service I received today just really got my blood boiling.I will state, as I always do in these types of situations, that I have worked many years in retail. I know what you're supposed to do. I know the ways I've displayed exemplary service and I know the ways I've slacked off. I get it, I really do.So I'm in the store early. Hardly any people in there. Weird for the Semi-Annual Sale time of year. Usually it doesn't matter what time you're there during the sale, it's always busy. I went through my usual bins and picked up a mess of undies and bras. Since no one was at the check out counter and I needed a spot to go through things, I set them down and started to try and chat with the sales chick. I actually always like to do this, just to shoot the breeze, but also to get their opinions on items I'm buying. The girl behind the counter was having non of this though.I asked her about a bra and she said she didn't know about that one, but said it should work. I understand, you can't try them all. But the thing that really irked me was that she was definitely not hiding her annoyance at me setting down my things on the counter. I even looked back to make sure there were no people checking out behind me. Ghost town. Tumbleweed rolled by. No one.So I'm going through my stuff and separating what I want and don't want and she's sighing and grabbing things saying ""Soooo, you DON'T want these???"" Um, I'm not asking you to help me sort things. I'm not holding up a line. I'm just trying to not spend $$$ on an accidental XS pair of undies that got mixed in! After that, it's not exactly what she said, but how she acted. I have never felt more uncomfortable in a retail store before. I ended up grabbing my discards and putting them back myself (which I really don't mind doing, but after she huffed and puffed, I didn't even want to deal with her). The thing is, I was nice the entire time. I don't expect you to sit there and be sugary sweet either. Just do what you were hired to do. Be nice and sell some bras. If you come to work in a bad mood, the real world is not going to give you a hug. Suck it up and do your job or work where you don't have to talk to anyone else ever."
"I hate this place.It's very loud, the service is very poor, and the food is so-so.If you want good Chinese in Pittsburgh, try China Palace (Shadyside) or Sesame Inn (Station Square or North Hills).  They're quieter, with very good food & service."
"Honestly, I'm furious. I enjoyed PF Chang's restaurants in the Chicago area, and my wife and I have eaten a few times at this Pittsburgh-area location. Over the last year, we have tried repeatedly, but the 90-120 minute wait for dinner is unacceptable. We tried going early, late -- it never made any difference. The front staff was rude, and the wait was too long.Tonight, we had a special date planned, and made reservations a week in advance. We came in the door exactly on time, waited in the line to see the front staff, and we were promptly handed a pager. They couldn't tell us when we would be seated.I imagined a short wait, so we went outside, crossed into a store to wait (since the entrance of this location is so packed, it's impossible to wait at the bar or in the meager seating).After 20 minutes we gave up. We went back to PF Chang's and the front office staff still couldn't tell us when we would be seated. I saw open tables.What on earth is the point of accepting reservations if you do not honor them?The food here is good, but certainly not great. We went to a local Thai place and were seated with no problem in 5 minutes. The food was much better, the service was good even in a crowded busy restaurant. Oh, and the local place was a much more reasonable price.We certainly will never visit PF Chang's again."
"This was my first time at this PF Chang's and I was not impressed. The service was extremely slow even though it was a Sunday night and the restaurant was not very busy. The portions were small. They were also playing 5 year old pop music really loud. Pop music?! Come on--this is an ""Asian Bistro."""
"Rude unwelcoming short haired black hostess. Drinks were not good. Greasy spring  rolls Below par on every way.  No experience needed to work here"
"Walked in tonight, Wednesday, at 9:50, the place was empty. Asked for a table, the hostess told us one moment when she finds one for us, then proceeded to walk to a dirty table and clean it!  The phone rang and she answered it as we stood at the door. When she hung up the phone she walked back to the table and proceeded to clean it again!!  Didn't say a word to us. Unbelievable!  Will not be back there-- rude hostess!"
"We went last night Saturday night to P.F.Chang located at the Kierlands in Scottsdale. Terrible Experience!!! after waiting over one hour to be seated, we ordered calamari for appetizer which came with a horrible strange salty sauce and salt and pepper mix on the side. then I ordered beef and broccoli and my husband ordered a vegetarian dish with peanut sauce . After a long wait my food came so salty that I could not even eat and as much as I hate to complain but I had to let the waiter know, so he went to get me one with less salt. My husband's dish was OK. then the second one was a bit less salty but the meat had a terrible liver kind of taste which totally turned my stomach. I feel the reason they added so much salt was to hide the bad tasting rotted meat. Very bad experience. Our waiter was kind and sympathetic. ruined my evening out :("
"Let me start off by saying I have mostly simple tastes, and my favorite lunch spot for Chinese has been the New Dumpling House in Squirrel Hill. But since that restaurant is undergoing renovations, I was forced to try something new.So... I thought I'd try the chain PF Chang's Chinese Restaurant at the Waterfront. Wow, what an unsatisfying mistake that turned out to be.I started with a cup of their Wonton soup. At $2.95 it wasn't too outrageous of a price, the broth had some flavor and there was much more in it than I was used to, including three giant basil (I think?) leafs that covered everything beneath. In the broth were chunks of chicken, two shrimp, some sliced water chestnuts and two ""pork""-filled wontons. As I said, the broth had decent flavor, but the wontons were thick, doughy and under-cooked, and the chicken chunks were dry, which is amazing since they were drowned in broth! On a scale of bad to good, it was kind of meh.Next came my ""lunch-portion"" order of Chang's Kung Pao Chicken (the dinner portion is $5 more). At the New Dumpling House, this dish is served with a delectable dark, rich, tangy sauce, which I was really hoping for... Not at PF Chang's. On my plate I received about 8 quarter-size chunks of lightly breaded and browned chicken, 7 hot Chinese red chili peppers (mostly inedible unless they are diced into a sauce), a handful of blanched, unsalted peanuts, a few sliced scallions, and a bed of the most bland brown rice I have ever encountered. Uncle Ben would've been ashamed if that stuff came out of one of his boxes.Glaringly, there was NO SAUCE!. None at all.I've had Kung Pao Chicken in New York City, San Francisco, and even from a hole in the wall in Bethel Park, PA that was much, much better. Never have I had it served in such a bland, skimpy, and overpriced way! The ""lunch-portion"" cost was $9.95.At The New Dumpling House, I could have a delicious lunch, with soup, entree and complimentary hot tea, and I could leave satisfied with just $8 out-of-pocket -- and that includes the tip.The service was decent. However, lesson learned. One and done. Never going back to PF Changs."
"The only thing this place has going for itself is the decor. The food is very Americanized and not true at all of what real Chinese good should look or taste like, and the host/hostess think their doing us a favor by seating us."
"Dumb, dumber and dumbest are running the hostess stand. They gave me 7 different estimates on the wait time, none of which was accurate. John Tapper is needed on this property."
"I went with my family late at night ,the food was not good at all , it looked like the left over , I hate it.The service was not that professional!!!!!!"
"We hadn't been at PF Changs for awhile and now I remember why....The service was terrible. The silverware was dirty. We waited almost 15 minutes for water glasses to be brought to the table. The waiter forget several things we asked for and above all, the food was tasteless and the portion sizes smaller than lunch sized portions. We were there before the dinner crowd started so the lack of service or food quality can't be blamed on a busy time. Don't think we will be going back there."
"I was a little peeved that the gluten free version of the Buddha Feast cost $10.50 when the regular version cost $9.50. So you're charging a dollar more to give me the gluten-free version of a veggie, tofu, and rice platter?? Regardless, it's worth it to get the gluten-free soy sauce (which I buy for myself and I know isn't THAT expensive). When my dish comes out, it's literally just steamed veggies and rice. No tofu, no seasoning or sauce. I ask why there's no tofu and the response is that the tofu has gluten in it. When I ask if there should be any sauce (aka flavor) to the dish I'm informed I could've ordered any other gluten-free dish's sauce to go along with it. Thanks for the info now...yes I'll take the GF beef broccoli sauce on the side. The sauce comes out and it's actually tasty so my food was finally interesting enough to eat, even though now I'm extra annoyed at paying $10.50 for steamed veggies and rice and why the menu made no mention that you wouldn't get flavor or tofu. To top it all off based on how miserable I feel now, I'm pretty sure the beef broccoli sauce they brought out contained gluten anyway! So I paid more, got less, and still got gluten in my food!?!? Not a happy customer. Not going back. Not going to recommend it to anyone."
"Went there today to have my birthday lunch, it was about 1:45 so the place was not crowded AT ALL. Got seated not far from the hostess station and sat for close to 15 mins without anyone coming to the table, no water, nothing. The table next to us who got seated after us had a server and water by the time we left. Got up to leave and the hostess said ""is everything OK"" I said ""no, no one ever came over""and we went to Bravo and had a great lunch! I like PF Chang's in general but if the 2 hostesses watched us sit there for 15 mins I have no idea why they didn't do something. I won't be going back here anytime soon."
"My daughter and I went to Panera Waterfront, Homestead Pa. around 4 pm on a Saturday and TRIED to order a dozed bagels.  We inquired as to when more Asiago bagels would be available and the counter person responded with we won't be making more bagels  that's all we have.  Thinking maybe this was a mistake I tried calling in for a dozen bagels at 3 pm on Saturday a couple weeks later and was told the same thing that Panera ' a neighborhood bakery' was OUT of French Toast bagels at 3 pm and won't be making any more.  I find it interesting they have many employees standing around I could see if they were busy but they aren't busy and items are in the oven baking and with several hours left open for business they easily deny customers product they want to purchase surely it doesn't take very long to bake 6 bagels when given a couple hours.  Maybe they should not be so concerned about the leftovers being donated instead they should focus on customers reasonable request."
Non existent internet service.   I came here to do some work on my laptop and the internet speed wasn't strong enough.  :(
Stopped by Sunday morning. The light roast coffee was cold. I ordered a Steak & Egg breakfast sandwich. The Steak was ice cold. The slice of tomato that I had them add was not ripe. Panera quality should be consistent no matter what location you visit. Very disappointing considering their pricing structure.
"I shop at Target on a regular basis and usually have no problems.  My holiday shopping included stocking stuffers and I bought 2 of you $5 DVD.  When I tried to return one DVD out of EVERYTHING I purchased a single $5 DVD I forgot my receipt we were give $4 back when I asked Donna the counter person why only $4 she said that we can only give the current sale price without a receipt, that makes sense I thought accept the current price WAS $5.  I pointed to the movies that were clearly marked $5 and she said I don't know what the policy is or why you only get $4 back.  ONE DOLLAR !!!!!  GREAT Customer Service Donna at Target"
"Let's start this review by saying that when we are at that point, my girlfriend and I will be going to Jos. A. Bank for mine and my groomsman's suits.  Allow me to give you a numbered breakdown of the issues we encountered when renting from Men's Wearhouse to be the groomsmen in our friends wedding.1- They never contacted us after the fitting after saying there would be a followup call.  The other groomsmen and I had to follow up repeatedly to get an answer as to when our tuxedos would arrive and the staff were very short with our honest questions over the phone.2- They sent two of our tuxedos to Homestead when we asked for them to be sent to Ross Park Mall during the fitting.3- When one of us called two days prior to the wedding to ask if our tux's had arrived the guy answering the phone said ""Oh... I don't know"" (insert an awkward, pregnant pause here while waiting for him to say ""Let me check that for you"") he instead said ""Well, I'm going to hang up now.""  And he made good on that promise, and hung up.4- Despite saying we'd get a call a few weeks ahead of the wedding to be resized in case one of us gained a few lbs over the winter, this call never came so we basically had to hope that everything fit as it needed to.5- We were at one point informed that MW had our emails on file and that when our tuxes arrived at the store we would receive an email letting us know.  Not a single groomsman received any such email to that effect.6- One of the groomsmen randomly received a black tie while everybody else had white.  Another received no studs.  We discovered this approximately two hours to show-time while relatively far from civilization.7- On picking up my tux I informed the associate ""I'll be unable to get to a Men's Wearhouse for a few days after the wedding, is this alright?"" to which she responded ""Yeah that should be fine"" so when my girlfriend graciously dropped off my tux for me a few days later and learned of the $100 late fee, I was totally caught off guard.8- My girlfriend was also caught totally off guard by the associate at Ross Park Mall who was incredibly rude to her when  he informed her of said late fee.9- As the Best Man I was given a coupon card for $50 off my next rental at Men's Wearhouse.  Since I am in another wedding next month with rentals from MW I figured this would be an opportune time to use it.  Imagine my shock while paying for the next weddings rental, when I presented the coupon and was told ""Oh, that isn't for this.  That is intended for YOUR wedding.  Oh and it expires on December 31st of this year."" 10- The groom himself decided to use a coupon to purchase a suit for the wedding and to own, rather than rent a tux for the occasion.  He was ensured by the Homestead staff that the coupon would be fine for this purpose and got fitted for it.  When he went to pick up his suit and pay with the aid of said approved coupon he was instead forced into an argument with an associate who insisted he could not use the coupon towards the suit that an associate a few weeks earlier had insisted he could use.  Granted, now I am speaking for another person so take that with as much salt as you may, but he reiterated this fact to me several times prior to his wedding last week.Over my friends wedding weekend, any time anything even went slightly wrong at and around his wedding, the joke between the Groom and his Groomsmen was ""Effing Men's Wearhouse.""  For example, at a restaurant, ""Wait I asked for no onions on this sandwich. - Effing Men's Wearhouse!""  ""Noise complaint at the hotel room? Men's Wearhouse.""Another groomsman looked at me when we discovered the wrong color tie one of us received and said to me ""I hope you're taking notes for your own impending wedding"" to which I replied ""Perhaps I could find better service from GoodWill of Western PA""Congrats Men's Wearhouse.  You became the butt of every joke for every mishap for an entire weekend around a wedding to which you provided the suits.TL;DR - 10 mistakes, several rude associates and 1 future groom going to Jos. A. Bank."
"We rented tuxedos for a wedding had to go down twice for fittings they we still wrong everyone's tuxedos were to big the pants were falling off everyone. The staff was not helpful in any way the walk away from you and don't come back. The worst tux I've ever rented you think if u pay $180 for a tuxIt should fit you take my advise if your going to rent a tux don't go to the men's warehouse in the water front."
"Let me start out by saying that my husband loves the MW at Westmoreland Mall, and even rented his tux there for our wedding without issue. Last year, he also rented a tux there for an out-of-town wedding he was in. After the wedding was over (the next day, before we returned home), we returned the tux to a MW at the local mall, also sans any issues.Recently, said husband got a promotion and bought some dress pants and shirts from MW at the mall, and was sent a $50 gift card. Last weekend, we decided to head down to The Waterfront....lo and behold, there's a MW in Homestead. Who knew? So, we head to MW to see if he can get something for free. Before we go in, I ask him, how much are pants normally at MW? He said, oh about $50 or $60. Okay, well the cheapest pair of pants we find are around $130, but most around $200?! I'm shocked, never thought men's dress clothes were so pricey. Again, who knew? Surprisingly, we were able to sift through the sale racks and were able to find one pair of pants on sale for $19.99 and dress shirts for $14.99! Very exciting! The problem was the staff and the store itself. First of all, the store was messy. Sales racks had clothes out of place and shirts rolled up, not a good impression for a 'high end' men's clothing store, not to mention it was hard to look for sizes etc. with everything out of place.The biggest issue was with the staff. There were five employees in the store. Okay, I get it, they work on commission, but seriously. The one and only employee who approached us, and I can't remember her name but she was a middle-aged Russian woman- was a shark! She asked if we need help, we both say no, we're fine. Just looking. I am much more assertive than my husband, however, which she realized right away. Needless to say, she wouldn't leave us alone. I tried several times - nicely - to tell her we were just looking around. My husband said, I'm looking for some dress shirts and pants. maybe a tie. She just doesn't get it...keeps asking ""Do you want to look at more ties?"" ""We have nice blazers and jackets"" I'm finally like, lady we're only here because we have a gift card, we don't plan on spending a ton of money. Getting her to leave us alone was near impossible. If it would have been me alone, I would have walked out. However, I knew my husband wanted to use the gift card.The worst part is there were other customers in the store that no one was waiting on. Some of which were looking around for assistance. I didn't get it.Continuing on, check out was a nightmare! Each and every item rang up more than the price tag. She had to end up cancelling the sale and re-doing the whole thing. We had to carefully scrutinize every thing she rang up, to make sure we weren't overcharged. We ended up going over the $50 - obviously. So, she says, ""You can swipe your card there."" I said, ""We have cash"" and omg you would have thought it was the end of the world. They had no money in the drawer and she actually had to send another employee in the back to get us change. Let's just say, I'm sure my hub won't returning here anytime soon. You can buy nice men's clothing almost anywhere else for less money and less hassle. Pros: None"
"This store has such bad service. The service staff are rude rude rude.  Save your money, shop elsewhere."
"I love BBB; however, this location is terrible. It is RARE that I find an employee that actually helps you voluntarily. I feel that everyone hates their jobs, especially the manager, Davina. I work at a more upscale retail store and I feel it is my responsibility to genuinely welcome, smile, greet, and service our clients. Maybe I'm reaching too high with BBB. I feel they expect YOU to greet THEM and make THEM feel comfortable. I never could understand this mentality. Maybe they should pay ME for this responsibility."
"We had the worst possible experience at the Eat N Park at Waterfront on 2/12/10 at around 10pm. Our waitress (Annemarie) was inattentive and got us the wrong order. We ended up with a dish we had not even ordered and still got charged for it on the check. One of my friends ordered a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, which according to the menu description, should've had lettuce and tomato in it. But the sandwich that arrived on our table had none of those ingredients. When pointed out to the waitress, she just brought some lettuce and tomatoes in a plate! How crude! Spoke to the manager after paying the full check and first of all, she did not even offer to re-imburse for the item we did not even order, and that had been forcibly thrust upon us. When I asked the manager about the Buffalo Chicken sandwich not having any lettuce and tomato, she said they just got new menus and that description is not correct and that Buffalo Chicken Sandwich is supposed to be without lettuce and tomato! What a lame excuse! Even your online menu says under the description for a Buffalo Chicken sandwich that its supposed to have both those ingredients - ""Served with lettuce and tomato on a fresh-baked Kaiser roll."" - That's what the last line in the description of Buffalo Chicken Sandwich says. Shame on you Manager for lying! Instead of admitting her fault, she was blaming it to a new menu!Not only did we have to pay for something that we didn't order or eat, but we got sub-standard food that was different from what was described in the menu, and had to deal with a really bad waitress and insensitive and deceitful manager to top off the whole experience. I am never going to come back to any Eat N Park location ever again, and will never recommend one to any of my friends either. What a waste of time and money! Plus dealing with callous and lying people - my goodness, I surely had my patience tested this evening!"
"Ugh. I've always been an Eat n Park fan, but this place was awful. It was a Friday night and granted it was pretty busy, but gawwwwwd. It seemed like every single employee was around 16 years old. The service was very slow. We ordered an appetizer platter and cheese fries to split. Easy enough, right? Well they didn't fry anything long enough so it was soggy and all the breading was falling off everything. My drink was never refilled. Even worse, we noticed ants crawling all over the window sill next to us!Half an hour later the server decides to ask ""You gettin' dessert?"" We ordered slices of pie to go. My ""slice"" of strawberry pie was two strawberries and a few crumbs of crust. We went up front to pay to find one lady at the register (who seemed to be the sole adult employee) counting her drawer and nobody else in sight. We stood there and evil eyed her for a few minutes and she finally took a break from her conversation to say someone would be with us. A few more minutes and finally the girl who was our server rings us up. I asked for a different, ACTUAL slice of pie, which she managed to get about five minutes later. Basically the whole experience was pure torture, which is disappointing."
"Possibly the worst dining experience I've had.  My husband and I were riding the bike trail in Pittsburgh and we decided to grab a bite to eat here since this location is right along the trail.  We noticed there were many tables open on the patio so we requested to sit outside.  It was rather busy inside so we waited patiently for 20 minutes until it was our turn to be seated.  The hostess then took us to a table inside the restaurant.  Not wanting to be rude, I asked if they were not putting anyone outside for some reason... She said the person who took our name didn't indicate that we wanted to sit outside (however, I watched her write ""patio"" next to our name).  We were then led outside and told to sit where ever we wanted... Because it was still basically empty... Finally happy to be seated, we waited another 10 minutes or so for our waitress to come.  She asked if we were ready to order both our meals and drinks so we did.  It took another 10 minutes to get our drinks which we quickly drank because we were thirsty from riding.  We were able to get a refill before we got our food since it took over 40 minutes from the time we ordered it.  The waitress came back one more time after we were done eating and I asked it I could talk to someone about how long everything took but she did not seem interested.  No apology.   Nothing.  She simply said that sometimes they aren't told when someone is seated outside.  Maybe that would explain the initial wait but why the terrible service after she clearly knew we were there?This Eat'n Park is a joke.  Extremely slow service and a rude waitress on top of it.  The food was ok, but paying for that meal made me feel like I was being robbed.  A group of people at the table next to us walked out after waiting 10-15 minutes for a waitress to acknowledge them.  Even when a woman at the table asked our waitress if she could order drinks, she just went inside and ignored them.  Whoever manages this restaurant should be ashamed!"
"This has to be the worst restaurant at the waterfront. From the second I walked in the door no one acknowledged my sister or myself for at least five to ten minutes, which I thought was weird because they were not busy. The manager, who was standing close and talking to another employee looked briefly at us, didn't smile or welcome us, turned and continued her conversation. We finally get sat at a booth that the hostess sloppily wiped off, left crumbs all over the seat and left old trash sitting on the table. We sat in the booth for ten minutes waiting for someone to come wait on us before I finally decided enough was enough and left. My sister loves Eat n Park but every time I enter the waterfront store I'm severely disappointed.  I've been a manager and a cook at two very busy restaurants in Oakland for over six years so I know what I'm talking about. I have never let anyone stand in a doorway like that, I would wait on you myself until the waitress could get to you. It is appalling to see what that place has become. I will never go back to that place again."
The waitress there are extremely rude .  On two occasions that I went there the same rudeness was there in 2 of the older wait staff.   Not sure what this is about..??  The first time a lady friend of mine did not order the Buffett and the watress tried to charge me..then proceeded to argue with me...lol..this morning.. another older last kept rolling her eyes at every quetion I had...lol...NEVER GO THERE AGAIN..
"I'm not a mean reviewer, if you look at the other places I've reviewed, but this was just so so so disappointing. The Shanghai style Merlin was very poorly done. The meat was extremely bland, with very little seasoning. I have a very low sodium tolerance and yet I still found this fish to be made too bland. The rice was entirely uncooked and it made crunching sounds as I took my first bite. I talked to the waitress and she offered to bring out another side. It wasn't the same. The whole dish was a fail and I don't think I am ever coming back again :("
"Will I come here again?  Yes absolutely for drinks, they knocked the Ketel One extra dirty blue cheese olive martini outta the park.  The ambiance is very nice.  Of the 4 types of reviews I give (awesome, OK, bad where they get slammed and bad where I hope they improve) here I am giving the heartfelt ""bad where I hope they improve.""  Our waitress was very friendly and did a good job.  I mentioned the gritty redskins of the mashed potato.  We went with appetizers she recommended.  Not good.  Seared ahi tuna: horrible flavors mixed with the rub, the prep, the tuna wasn't cool inside, the chips were not good, there was no soy sauce but there was wasabi.  NOT good.  With heartfelt advice, compare this against Outback's ahi tuna appetizer and it's no contest.  The chef should do so.  (He's a nice guy like me I hope.)  BBQ shrimp: go try Redstone's (Philly) buffalo shrimp appetizer.  It is chilled, very delicious.  This appetizer was recommended and was garbage.  The barbecue sauce was horrible, overwhelmed and left an unsavory aftertaste in both my and my clients' palate.  Gordon Food Service or Sysco BBQ sauce.  A real ""must-miss"".  Cod entree was OK.  The skillet beans were too firm, too mature, they need petite green beans.  Potato skin had grit in the mashed.  Why 1 star?  The price was close to Capital Grille, but far from the cuisine.  I hope they spruce it up.  The place is nice."
"Went here for happy hour.  Initially, service was prompt, but after the first drink order, we had to track a server down in the kitchen to take the food order.  It took so long to get, we just left.  Will never go back."
"Whoever gave this place 4 or five stars must be out of their minds. Had dinner here in July and it was so so. I was looking for a fish place in town again, and figured, after reading positive reviews that it had improved. Yikes. Bad decision. The staff seemed put out that anyone was here at all, and were seemingly puzzled by the menu. I watched two bartenders trying to figure out how to make a strawberry daiquiri for 5 minutes, which was admittedly entertaining. I ordered the chowder and the crab cakes. The chowder was basically flour stew with potatoes. I'm guessing that there may have been a clam or two in there somewhere, but you couldn't taste it if there was through the flour. The crab cakes were definitely frozen, and not made from blue crab. If you're going to offer Chesapeake crab cakes, they had damn well better be the real deal. Zero flavor and dry as hell. Stringy, Asian crab that was definitely pre-made. Terrible. I don't like to rip a spot, but this was a seriously weak restaurant. Don't know why I expected western PA to offer up the goods, but if Chicago can do it well, why not Pittsburgh. Best analogy- the Olive Garden of seafood"
"Went there for dinner tonite. Visiting from out of stat and it's close to the hotel where we're staying. Everyone complaining around us. Took our order quickly. Told they ran out of bread and we could have crackers. Waited a half hour for our food.   Waitress said they were running behind in the kitchen and out of a lot of food. Asked the waitress to check on our food and waited for her to come back and when we saw her serving water to another group, we just left. Poor service and management."
"I have tried time and time again, to get myself to like this place and every time it's more disappointing than the last time. I had a take out order today, and when I called to place the order, I could tell that instantaneously, the bartender taking my order was not going to be a pleasure. Well that was an understatement. When I arrived to pick up my order, there was class A attitude from the minute I walked in with the bartender. Then I had a total of 5 bags and 2 fountain drinks (which she said she had absolutely nothing to put them in for me), and I asked her if she could help me carry the bags to my car.  Her reply ""no. I have tables I need to take care of."" I don't expect over-the-top service at this restaurant, but I do expect a smile, a nice and pleasant attitude, along with a little helpfulness. If you aren't having a good day, don't take it out on customers."
"This is a really hard review for me to write, simply because I cannot for the life of me find the words to explain the food. Lackluster, no, not really...Mediocre...no....Pedestrian/average/common...huh uh. Just 'eh.' It wasn't awful, terrible or even bad, and it wasn't great, good or even fine. It was just....edible, I guess.  We started with shrimp dumplings from the happy hour menu and the BF got seafood gumbo. I thought the gumbo was decent; he said 'eh', however we both agreed the dumplings were 'eh'. I got something called the market trio, which came with creole style rice, corn, a crab cake, a hunk of salmon and 5 shrimp. It wasn't terrible, inedible food, it was just....not good. And for $28 I wish I would have just gotten a bowl of the gumbo. The only thing that seemed to have any flavor was the rice. The BF got a crab and lobster stuffed cod, which again, was not bad just not good. It had a lemony-buttery sauce, that didn't taste quite lemony or buttery somehow. I know this is a stupid thing to gripe about, but I hatehatehate when restaurants charge necessarily high prices for pop. Soda, cola, pop, call it what you want, but it should never be more than $2.50. I usually just drink water with lemon, but I had a headache, so I ordered a coke. $325!! And having a BF who works for a restaurant, I know that pop costs them pennies! I see $2-2.50; some people drink glass after glass of the stuff, but $3.25 is simply ridiculous. Especially when the food kinda sucks. And I read other reviews and the decor is not classy. It's like it's trying to be classy, but real classy restaurants know its' not classy. It was a little like an over-priced, under-flavored Red Lobster without the kickass cheese biscuits. But when your food sucks at Red Lobster, you can always fill up on the delicious biscuits."
"Very bad purchase experience. I bought a shirt with a hole covered in the rolled up sleeves, but they denied my request to return it. I am so angery at this and will never shop their chothes anymore."
A group of us traveld here to go kenneywood park across the road but we decided not to after what we drove throuhg to get there so we atleast decided to get somthing to eat and man where we happey to get out alive. We where the only normal people in this place. The kids next to us who where only 14 where bragging and saying that they went to jail 2 times in their life. You had people selling their food outsdie the resturant. after seeing that we quickly left and hid in our cars with the doors locked. While we where in there my friend got hit on by 2 girls and they gave him there numbers while the other young guy across the table yeld dont do it dont do it. Must I say more? bottom line is dont go if you are normal and get the hell out of that area cause if you call a shank a happey meal toy then that is the resturant for you.
"You know it's bad when a McDonald's gets a 1 star review...I mean, seriously: none of us expect anything fancy when we go to a McDonald's. The whole point of going to McDonald's is indulging in some not-good-for-you food on the go in your busy life. In my case, I just wanted a small meal/snack that wouldn't cost me as much as the stuff in Kennywood would. I hadn't even eaten at a McDonald's in about eight years or so. And I quickly remembered why!Forget the fact that McDonald's food isn't great. We all know it's not great. The problem here is that they added insult to injury by giving you the worst customer service ever in addition to not so good food. For starters, I quickly discovered that the drive-thru here is the ABSOLUTE slowest line on planet Earth. You certainly won't be getting any fast food here! Then, once I FINALLY placed my order, and finally got to the window to pay (because of course I spent a lot of time waiting for the people in front of me to even get their orders), a young woman took my card, swiped it...and didn't say another word. I waited thinking she was printing a receipt - nope! Eventually - after whipping out her phone and sending a text or two - she realized I was still there and told me to go to the next window for my food. Whatever, I figured, forget the receipt; by then I was pretty sure she had moved on to other orders and couldn't print my receipt anyway. On to the next window, where I was given my food and drink...and I proceeded to quickly discover they gave me no straw and for some reason, layered my Big Mac as such: bread, bread, patty, patty, bread. ...seriously, how does one even mess that up? I give one brownie point because the fries really were actually pretty good...but they were not worth the wait or trouble.I concur with the other reviewers: skip this place. Completely. Just keep driving. Anywhere else is better and less of a waste of your time and money, and the people here are so slow that you'll spend more time waiting for your food then you will eating it."
"By far the absolute worst Mcdonalds in theWorld. You can pretty much rest assured that, after your long wait in the drive thru, your order will most definitely be wrong.  Calls to the owner go ignored. Rice Enterprises own a majority of the McDonalds in the South Hills.  They have all gone down hill in quality, service and cleanliness.  The owner has to be the problem."
"I was very disappointed in the quality of the pierogies and the haluski at Pierogies Plus.  I ordered them hot and I purchased enough so that I could have leftovers the next day.  When I got home and opened the containers, something smelled odd.  When I started to eat, it tasted just as odd.  As it turns out, what is referred to as 'butter sauce' is a misrepresentation of what it really is-----margarine, which I eliminated from my diet years ago because of the trans fats and the fact that any way you cut it, butter makes for a better product.  Sorry Allison B, ain't no butter here.  Margarine is used as a cost-cutting measure, and it just can't measure up.  I rinsed off the peirogies and browned them in some butter and my own onions.   The haluski got thrown away.  For the prices being charged for these products, the proprietor can well-afford to use butter."
This was a Good place to get pizza.  As far as I know they are No Longer Open at this Location.
Jackie B is dead on! The staff is ANYTHING but friendly. Actually downright mean!
"The food was alright. Not good. Not bad. And considering the portion, the prices weren't bad either. The service, on the other hand, was terrible. Severely understaffed. Three hours order to check. Worst of all the chef put cooked lobster tail back into the raw shell to serve it. Avoid at all costs."
"I would give our experience zero stars. Possible negative stars. It's Valentine's Day. An order was placed weeks in advance for a delivery. My boyfriend went to the shop to ask where the delivery was and the woman at the counter could not have cared less that he was perturbed. Weather conditions are not ideal for deliveries today but no attempt was made to communicate that the delivery would be delayed. Just a little ""hey, someone is sending you something special, we're doing the best we can"". Placate us! I received a call at 5:30 saying I needed to be home to receive the delivery! Where's the surprise in that? What if it's just a regular day and I'm getting surprise flowers, would I have to get them myself if I wasn't home? Well, my flowers are not being delivered today. My arrangement is sitting at the shop because I was chosen to be the loser of ""who gets their flowers on time"". The surprise of my arrangement was also ruined by the shop when they said what it was, how beautiful it was and I'd be very happy. Well, we're not happy at all about the service. At all. Don't know how this place is still in business with the awful customer service.Edit: my flowers were delivered at 1:05 on 2/15 after I told the shop they needed to be delivered by 1:00. They were given a range of 9-1. I was offered a box of Whitman's chocolate as an apology. Really? How about a refund. The arrangement my boyfriend selected is gorgeous but the flowers are wilted and spotted already. I'm pretty sure they ruined any future chances of me getting surprise delivery flowers."
"I have never gotten an order correct from this specific McDonald's. I'm not sure what the problem is, but it is never, ever right. It is never quick. The staff is always rude. After trying at least 12-15 times over the past year, I've finally given up hope on this place. Do not recommend."
My orders have come out bad pretty much every time I have ordered from here. The chicken nuggets come out under par. I'm lucky if the fries come out right. My last experience is the last straw. I recently posted a photo of my Chicken Ranch Club. That has no chicken. This is ridiculous. I am done going to this Mcd's.
"Delivery is slow and not even close to the best Chinese in the area.  No matter if it's rice or noodles or chicken or pork, everything tastes off--like it's been overcooked in mop-bucket-water.  Try House of Lee instead."
"The pros:You get a TON of food for your money. If the food was actually decent, this would have been even better because... LEFTOVERS. They have coupons on their website that you can use whenever. The cons:The woman who answers the phone is kinda rude. You try to ask her questions and she gets an attitude with you like you're wasting her time. My pork dumplings were ""fried"" only on one side and were raw in the middle. Everything was pretty darn salty. Yeah, I get it. Chinese food tends to be a little salty, but this was unacceptably salty. Leftovers... Yes this is also a con because I threw it away. Suffering through it once was enough! If you're craving something made fresh that is spicy and sweet, you're not going to find it here. Just very greasy, very salty, poor excuse for Chinese takeout."
"I just moved into my new apartment in the area and called for a take out order. The place had received good reviews so I thought ""Why not?"" I was hung up on twice before I could even get my order out. We were finally able to place an order and told 5-10 minutes. We live 15 minutes from this restaurant and we left immediately after placing the order. Ten minutes later, my phone rings and it is the man who took our order telling me that he was closed and would not wait for us to get there to pick up our food because he had told us 5-10 minutes. If you are going to order from here, please make sure you stick to their timelines. And if you do go to pick it up and make it there in time, it is very hard to find."
"If you have any common sense at all, please don't stay here.  Once, it almost burnt down...and I'm pretty sure most of the locals were chanting ""burn, baby, burn."""
"Horrifying.  This place should be ashamed of itself.  DO NOT STAY HERE.  Beyond dirty, just absolutely rank."
"OMG who wrote the review below? A big fat liar/someone that was paid to write that! I stayed there for an hour this past weekend (my friend and I were both intoxicated and figured laying down a few hours would get us better suited to finish driving home). This place looks like it hasb't been cleaned (or furnished) since the 80s. Literally there was grime on the walls, and squashed, unwiped bug smears too. Ok, so not the best, but for two hours, we could deal. We looked for bed bugs, and didn't see any immediate signs of them- so we laid down to rest. After about 20-30 minutes, we both started itching like crazy. I ran to the bathroom mirror (there was mold all over the bathroom) and saw bed bug bites all on my shoulders, arms, and legs. HORRIBLE!! PLEASE Health Department, shut them down! It's deplorable in there!!"
I can't even rate this place! Its absolutely disgusting! I begged the health department to shut them down! I was forced to stay a night here and it was so disgusting! I woke up with bed bug bites all over my body! Just filthy! DO NOT STAY HERE!
"Im writing this out of anger.  So bare with me.  I was desperate for a place under $70/night.  I  AM NOT A PICKY PERSON!  I was homeless in Texas for 3 months on the streets once.   Life has turned around for me since then.  The Avalon motel is a sesspool of filfth and disease. I am NOT exaggerating!  HOW IN HELL DID THIS PLACE PASS A HEALTH INSPECTION. BULL!   I checked in at 8pm on a thursday night.  Got my key, and walked in. LOOKED HORRIFYING, But what the hell.  I was tired and just needed a warm half clean bed to sleep in.  I peeled back the sheets and noticed tons of little black spots on the pillows and sheets.  The closer I looked I realized there were tiny smears of blood all over the sheets, too.  That alarmed me because those are sure signs of bed bugs.  So I peeled back the fitted sheet and OMG!!!!  Dead dried bed bug carcasses, bed bug poop, blood splotches all lined the entire length of the mattress.  not exaggerating.I had the misfortune of living in an apartment building once that became infested with bed bugs after I bought a used mattress off Craigslist.  IT WAS HELL getting rid of them- even after throwing the mattress out.  If ONE EGG gets on your property, your done.  Every night you will go to bed and be unable to fall asleep because you feel them crawling on you. Once you finally DO manage to fall asleep you will wake up the next morning to dozens of bites all over your body that can inflame into the size of dimes and ooze puss.  They itch bad and take Weeks to dissappear.AS SOON AS I saw the bed bugs (5 minutes after entering the room) I went back to the clerk and kindly demanded my money back on grounds that the room was not up to health code.  I could put up with the other deplorable disgusting repulsive problems with the room, but I DREW THE LINE AT SLEEPING WITH LIVE PARASITES IN MY BED.    WTF.I begged for my money back and explained that proir to check in I only had $100 in my bank account and spent half of it on the room and did not have enough money left to go to another hotel.  And asked repeatedly to PLEASE get my money back for a room that I had NOT EVEN USED and JUST purchased 10 minuted prior. The clerk refused and toted their beloved ""Health Department Approval Certificate""  how in the hell they got it---I dont know.  Had to be fake.   She called me a liar and said there were no bed bugs and no one else has complained.  I practically begged her to walk to the room with me so I could show her the obvious HUNDREDS of bed bugs infesting the entire room.  Her response?  .....""  Oh Im not going out there, its cold! ""  .....These are the kind of people were dealing with folks. And she  proudly kept my $50 and said I was welcome to go sleep in my car in the 6 degree weather.  Disgusting people who live to cheat citizens out of their money. The epitome of whats wrong with the world.  Very SAD,   Oh yeah..... so, don't stay here."
"This motel is so ghetto, even the bedbugs carry guns. Don't stay here unless you're looking to indulge your sense of urban adventure. Fact: this motel has an hourly rate. Think of that what you will. The only good thing I can say about the Avalon Motel is, no one has gotten murdered here... recently."
Got bit up . Bed bugs wouldn't believe me I had to show my bite marks .. Even then refused to acknowledge me
"TERRIBLE! No one expects fast food to be gourmet, but this experience would make corporate cry! Ordered food for 2 adults (full meals) and for one child and was charged for 2 more adult meals, I asked why the amount was so high and the employee said nothing to me, looked the other way and yelled for a manager. Still feeling over charged but not wanting to agitate the situation any further we left with 1 less drink then we ordered, cold food and a soda water instead of sprite because no one changed the syrup. Never again."
"We keep expecting their food to be better than the last time. I've had enough. Ordered two spicy chicken combos yesterday at around 5 o'clock. You'd think the food would be fresh during the dinner-time rush. Well, you'd be wrong. The sandwiches and fries were all lukewarm, and both chicken filets were so dry and tough that they must have been sitting under a heat lamp for hours. We ordered an unsweetened iced tea and a Sprite with no ice. Received an unsweetened tea with no ice and a cup of ice with some Sprite in it.We've previously been treated rudely for having the gall to use the drive thru 20 minutes before closing time. I'm trying to remember if we have ever been served a satisfactory meal there, but I'm having trouble coming up with a single example. I can only assume that the manager is never there or is so incompetent as to defy belief. This location coasts by solely on the reputation of other Wendy's. Do yourself a favor. Go to Burger King or McDonald's down the road, or hike up to the Wendy's at West View Park."
"They kept trying to staple my poor dogs infected wound. After taking her to another vet, I was educated about wound care. After she was treated properly, she healed quickly."
"Where to begin. I guess I'll start with me taking my last cat there about two years ago because I was worried he was sick. He cried constantly when I left his sight. I assumed he was trying to tell me something so I brought him to AVH where he had been seen before by Dr. Albu (wonderful vet). This time my cat was treated by another vet, who simply wrote ""meows too much on"" on the chart. Great diagnosis.Hoping to get a different vet next time I took my other cat there. Everyone is always very kind and loving to him, but it always takes the vet at least 40 minutes past the appointment time to see him. Not to mention, they are always so overbooked that I am forced to sit in the waiting area with at least 4 barking dogs at once. Their owners try to calm them, but my cat shudders and shakes in his cage and I am unable to hold him and comfort him. You try holding a scared cat in a room full of dogs. I won't be returning to AVH."
"They do NOT care about animals.  I had been taking bothof my dogs there for 4 years for regular veterinary care. My youngest dog came down with stomach cancer while I was unemployed, she needed to be euthanized and I made an appointment, put my poor bloated sick dog into the car and took her for her final visit.  They demanded I pay up front before she was even seen by a vet and I asked for billing, having been a years-long patient who has always paid I didn't think it would be an issue, especially considering the pain my dog was in.  They refused to do the euthanization and would rather leave a sick animal (years long animal patient of theirs! ) in pain and suffering than to do the courtesy of sending a bill to a regular customer.  DISGUSTING.   Who does that? Never will I take another animal there, I now have a new vet that actually cares about animals and how they feel and whether they are in pain."
"STAY AWAY, the owners are so rude, they blatantly say they are not doing well and then try to pretend they have the best hairdressers in Pittsburgh. they make you feel so unwelcome, advertise they offer a bunch of services and then when you ask they snap at you that they only do hair.  it was so awkward and weird .  i received warnings not to get my hair done there so i was going to get a pedicure because i had a gift certificate.  she told me her employees will only take cash if they have to touch a client's feet.  I may go there just to get bangs trimmed since i do not want to completely waste the certificate, but this place gives me the creeps, sounds dirty, and has beyond bad customer service.  They definitely do NOT know how to run a business and it is obvious why they are not doing well. Sue and Kristi pass the phone back and forth because noone wants to take a call.  she reiterates that the business is doing bad and they need more clients.  i have never experienced a ruder salon, or should i say dead beat shack."
"I think it is ridiculous that they say they need more clients!  I was all ready to be a new client.  I had a 12:30 appointment with them, and when I arrived at 12:30 on the dot, the place was locked and dark and no one was there!  I waited for five minutes (in the rain), and they still didn't show.  I called and left a voicemail saying that I was still willing to wait, and I understood if there was some confusion, but could they call my cell (I gave them the number, as I had previously given my home number when I made the appointment).  I waited nearby at a coffee shop, went back after another five minutes, and it was still locked and I hadn't received a call.  And I am definitely not estimating the time, either.  I was willing to wait a bit, and I looked very closely at the time on my phone to be sure that I wasn't jumping the gun on calling and then leaving.  Finally, I went on with my day and when I got home, they had left a voicemail on my HOME PHONE, which I had specifically asked them not to call, saying, ""Oh hi.  Sorry you missed me, but I was MAYBE two minutes late at the most.  I hope you haven't left, but you should just call back to reschedule.'  Seriously?  When I was waiting, another woman came to the door.  I thought she worked there, but she was just another client, also trying to get in!  When I told this story at another local business, the women there said that I was probably the fourth person who had had this same experience at this place.  I couldn't believe it.  This place is the worst, and I have never even stepped inside!"
"Now I'm picky about my hair, but Mane Attractions was so bad that I walked out after about 15 minutes of watching the stylists work on other clients.I had desperately needed a haircut and walked in for a major trim and re-shaping of my layers.  First, the girl at the counter said my hair might be ""difficult"" due to the length (it was nearly long enough to sit on at the time) and that I would probably have to stand while it was cut.  Weird, but okay.  Second, no one there knew anything about donating to ""Locks of Love,"" and I feel like salons should be aware of things like that.  I needed a cut so I went for it anyway.I watched the two stylists while I waited for my turn.  One stylist told the client whose hair she was cutting that she was going to do something other than what they discussed because it ""wasn't looking right.""  Ummm, okay.  The other stylist was too busy checking her phone every three seconds to notice she was yanking on her client's hair so hard with the comb that she was giving her poor client whiplash.At that point, I just pretended like I had received an urgent text and said, ""I have to leave, so sorry ""as I bolted for the door."
"Got a key lime pie from this place. It was horrid. Icing was stale cake thick, crust was not even crunchy or had taste, and the key lime was weak. Pie looked it it was sitting out for a day or 2."
On October 11 2014 I placed a 140.00 order for tortes and cookies to be picked up the following Saturday and was told no problem. when I placed the order the girl taking the order was new so another girl helped but her attitude was very poor and told me that I had to put down a deposit and pay 10.00 for trays for cookies and they don't tray tortes. I told her that was fine and I paid the order in full. the following week I showed up and my order was never placed so they had nothing. No manager or owner could be reached and the poor girl waiting on me was so shook up. The Girl that had the attitude the week before and was suppose to place the order  was very nasty and insisted that it had to be under a different name.Long story short we had to make shift the order and put up with a very sarcastic counter girl. I will not return to this place again. I have been using them for years and never saw a business run like this. My daughters worked for years for a well known bakery in college and said were never left alone like this. Unfortunately a man beside me came in to pick up cupcakes for his childs birthday and it was paid for and experienced the exact same thing as I did. Shame on you Lincoln to run a bakery like this. Oakmont Here  I come. Oh and as for the cookies I got no trays and 4 dozen of sugar cookies that all looked the same. the girls that took the order were there and one whispered to the other wondering if they would be fired over this and the smart mouth answered no they don't worry about stuff like this and the lady just needs to get over it!
DO NOT BUY FROM METRO MOTORS ( BOB ) .i read ad on auto trader that had car listed with auto windows sunroof and many more options. Drove 45 minutes to look at vehicle to find it had no extras at all.Discussing with owner I placed 100 dollars Sarurday at closing and called Monday at 9 am to tell him I wasn't interesred.He kept deposit claiming I broke contract. This Dealer is the worst type of Used Car Dealer and the reason they get a bad reputation.  AVOID METRO MOTORS UNLESS YOU WANT RIPPED OFF. Turned Metro Motors into BBB and after investigating said they would leave negative review on Metro Motors for 3 years.
"I cannot imagine a more miserable place to shop than this jam-packed monstrosity.  This is a store that makes me thankful for Goodwill and The Salvation Army resale stores.  The customers and the staff are miserable at Red White and Blue.  The clothes are priced far higher than other such shops.  Merchandise is not refundable or exchangeable, and there are no fitting rooms!  One purchases clothes at their own risk!  What person would buy a suit under these conditions, hoping the pants will fit?  Unlike other stores, there is no senior discount and no credit cards accepted, a rare cash only business.  To the reviewer who boasts that everything is 50% off every day, how is that a sale?  It is bogus pricing.  Red White and Blue, uggh!"
Pittsburgh store is the worst thrift store I've ever shopped.OVERPRICED!!!!  Very high prices. Backwards policy of accepting cash only. Nasty! Don't waste your time or money!!! THere are much better places to shop for thrift in Pittsburgh!
"Love the store. Great stuff, High price. Buyer BEWARE of the RUDE cashier SYLVIA, extremely unpleasant, unwilling to help and always with NEGATIVE attitude. She needs customer service training....Someone please tell her to stop complaining about other customers or employees....Cashier that does window display is always kind, friendly and helpful."
"I have never been treated so terrible in my whole life. Here's my rant, a friend and I stopped in one day after high school. I was a senior at a catholic private school at the time so I was required to wear a fancy uniform so I looked highly presentable. I picked a shirt up I was thinking of getting and held it as we browsed through the store. They announced they were closing and I was across the store from where I got the shirt. Deciding not to get it, I placed it on a near by shelf. My friend checked out, and as we were walking out of the store a  woman that worked there said to me ""where is the shirt you were holding"". I told her I had placed it on the self in the back, and said sorry for not putting it back. She said "" I walked back there and didn't see it, so where is it"" and clearly implied that i stole it.  I told her again that it was on the shelf as nice as I could and she then told me that she didn't believe me and told me to go back there and get it or else she was going to search me. Now I get that it doesn't matter that the shirt was 50 cents because stealing is still wrong but because I didn't steal it and told her so I feel Im justified in being furious that I was publicly humiliated and falsely accused over 50 cents. I walked to the back of the store picked it up and started walking back and then the lady said in a grossly rude tone "" well I didn't see it back there"" no apology, no nothing. I handed it to her and walked out. I've never been there since. I was so angry I forgot to get her name tag so I could complain to the manager. I have never been treated so badly by anyone let alone a complete stranger and store clerk. I don't shop at stores that hire such terrible staff."
This place is overpriced and the service is not good at all.  When we where there children were riding bikes in the lot near the tables.  One almost hit our child.  Another customer said that if the owner had been there she would have not allowed the bikes to be there.  The cone was large to say the least but the taste left something to be desired.  Not the best neighborhood either with a bar nearby.  Our children were exposed to language that would have made a sailor blush.  We will not be back.  Also they will accept a credit card but not a debit card?????  Please get up with the times.
"I had a very unfortunate experience with this groomer. My dog  was not groomed to my specifications; infact she was butchered. I went to the trouble of taking a photo of my dog with  the haircut that I wanted, as well as speaking with the woman who assured me she would be grooming my dog. The owner groomed my dog, not the woman that I spoke with and she looked nothing like my dog when I picked her up. The owner was rude and did not even apologize for the horrible service. Do not take your dog there to be groomed!"
"I've been told several times that this place had a great brunch.  Upon arrival, the menu was very limited and the service was abysmal despite a nearly empty restaurant.  We literally waited 15 mins. at our table and then left prior to ordering."
"What a disappointment!! Evening started pretty badly and did not get much better.  We had reservations for 5 people at 7PM this past Saturday. Two of us were there early and rudely treated by the hostess. She was vague about seating us and we decided to wait at the bar. When the rest of our group arrived (on time!!), I informed the hostess and she looked at me blankly and then the packed restaurant.  She told me it would be awhile. Huh? When asked what ""awhile"" was, she said 20min.  But then seated us in 5 (she had to bus a table which I take it as one of the things she dislikes about her job - that and people).Food was a let down. Potato latkes were greasy and blah.  Fish tacos were recommended and were basically fried fish sticks.  Pumpkin risotta was heavy and confusing flavor wise.  Others had the same sentiments.Service was rough.  Long waits and lack of attentiveness. Noise level (couldn't converse at all) made the night just a bit harer to tolerate.Not sure Pino's will get a repeat visit.  Disappointment:("
"Bland food and poor service. Its a shame since it's a great location and could be much more, especially since there is always overflow from nearby point brugge."
"BEFORE Pino's was renovated, it was a tiny, unpretentious, hole-in-the-wall restaurant with a friendly atmosphere, and amazing Italian food. It was also a BYOB, which I love. This was our ""go-to"" restaurant.AFTER Pino's was renovated, there was a complete transformation. While the interior is now very nice, It's no longer a BYOB, and the staff is full of attitude, which seems to stem from the total arrogance of Pino himself.On our most recent visit, we were a party of four with reservations at 7:30 PM. We arrived at 7:25, and weren't even acknowledged until 7:40 PM. Pino was playing maitre d', and when he finally acknowledged our presence he seemed totally clueless and was overtly UN-apologetic. There were no open tables, despite having reservations. When 8:00 PM rolled around, I was frantically calling other local restaurants to see if we could get in. No such luck, since it was prime dining time on Saturday night. Finally, around 8:30 PM, the waitstaff brought a two person table up from the basement, crowded four chairs around it and jammed it into the middle of the restaurant for us to sit in. Pino then literally threw our menu's at us, and walked away. Not so much as a free drink for our inconvenience.The food is still good here, but I refuse to give my money to someone who CLEARLY does not appreciate your business. There are SO many good restaurants in the area, with owners/chefs who are happy to have you. Next time you think about going here, walk an extra block to the Point Brugge Cafe."
"The food here is ok but not worth the price. $15 corking fee? $9 a glass of garbage wine? Me thinks not.What really tops it off is the owner is beyond rude and doesn't care about the business. I heard it used to be much better but now I don't know anyone who eats there..."
"I went to Pino's with my three other friends for Restaurant Week and was underwhelmed and completely disappointed. We chose an option for each course of  the very limited Restaurant Week menu. I selected the baked eggplant caprese appetizer, Lazy Man lasagna Florentine and then the panna cotta for dessert. Baked eggplant caprese: the breaded eggplant was a soggy mess. Lazy Man Lasagna Florentine: it was essentially two huge lasagna noodles sandwiching huge clumps of spinach (I'm talking like a 3-inch high pile of clumped spinach) with a few mushrooms peppered in. The spinach ratio was out of control and I honestly ate a few bites and couldn't even continue. Panna cotta: this was the most decent of the items we ordered.My friend ordered off the regular menu, which she advised not to do since her food would come out at a different time?? Why? We tried my friend's appetizer of the Italian Fries, which are described on the menu as sounding very similar to the amazing fries at Point Brugge...but it was just a bowl of regular French fries, which were lackluster and misleading. She also got the house soup with chickpeas and it looked like Spaghetti-o's and tasted even worse.I don't know where all the positive reviews are coming from. There was not one thing we ate that was impressive in any way. All of it was overpriced and below mediocre. I wasted my money, and I will never, ever go back there."
"I went to Pino's recently, only to be disappointed by the owner himself. I guess I should have read the reviews on here before going, seeing as a lot of people echo the sentiments that I feel.After my mother sent back her extremely oversalted steak, the chef came out to ""apologize"". It was very embarrassing how he chastised her for not enjoying her meal. He then snidely commented, as walking away, that he would ""never salt his steak again"". I don't really take kindly to people speaking so rudely to my mother. She was very polite about sending it back and certainly didn't deserve any attitude. We had an event to attend, which we were very clear with to our waitress. So when my mother reordered another meal (a salad), which took another twenty minutes, my mom asked for it to be immediately wrapped up. The chef returned, obviously chewing to make a point, and sneered at my mother, announcing her steak that she refused to eat was actually quiet good. Well, I have never felt more embarrassed in a situation. I said he was being rude to my mother, a paying customer. He proceeded to get heated and tell me it was not his job to make people happy (!??!) and that everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal and we just had to get to the inside of the steak to appreciate it. The drama continued when he did not have change for $100 for a $57 bill. Sorry, how can you not have $33 in change?! He ended the night by throwing our bill in a crumbled mess on the floor and walking out. Overall, embarrassing. It was an embarrassing situation for anyone to witness. Take heed of the negative comments on this site. I certainly wish I would have."
"Very disappointing meal.  After waiting for a half hour, my meal arrived and we were told that my friend's meal would be coming in a few minutes. Very awkward.t.  Salad was average at best.  The beets tasted like canned beets and the chicken was covered with blackish oil from a burnt oil pan.  Then, to make matters worse the chef came out to argue with a patron who returned her food.  The chef came out to humiliate the customer explaining that her returned steak was great and himself was enjoying it.  Eating food from a customers plate was a real turn-off....what else does he do when cooking? To make matters worse, when paying the bill, the chef did not have change for a $100 bill for the customer who returned her steak..  It was very uncomfortable watching the elderly customer and her young friend deal with the situation. He kept  loudly requesting a credit card  and the women did not have one.   Another customer provided them with change as the chef crumbled the check. I think I would have just left and not paid....give the lady great for dealing with such a lunatic.Long story short....if you want to eat below average food and watch a chef loose it....this is your place!"
"This was the place I brought friends visiting from out of town when I wanted to show them the classy Italian  spots in Pittsburgh. After my visit last night, I have no desire to ever go again. I don't know the owner, Joe, personally but he has stopped by our table a few times and said ""dish looks beautiful."" He was always confident in his food which I guess is a good thing if the good is delicious,  which it usually is  The table next to ours had a two women, a mother and daughter. The mother asked the server for a new steak as hers was a bit salty (I've never had the steak as I'm vegetarian but my guests have mentioned the abundance of salt). The server apologizes and returns to the kitchen. The owner comes out and fakes an apology claiming his steaks are perfect. At this point the whole restaurant is listening it's that crazy.  The  best part? He comes out again and says ""I really enjoyed the steak you sent back."" He was eating the steak and had some in his mouth! I can't make stuff like this up!At this point the whole place feels bad for the mother and daughter. Clearly an awkward situation. The owner got so nasty the daughter tried to reason with him and he said ""it's not my job to make people happy"" that's strange considering he wants our business. So the mother tries to pay the bill with a $100 and leave but he said they can't make change. Eventually another customer helps make change and they leave.I couldn't finish my dinner I was so mad.  Maybe Joe was having a bad day but there is no excuse for how he treated those customers.  Sorry, we will never step foot in here again."
"Please, never go to this restaurant. The food ranges mediocre to downright bland, which wouldn't be so bad if it weren't so overpriced. I'm sorry, but $20 for a flatbread that's half the size of a pizza? Is it supposed to be an entrÌ©e, or a joke? $25 for a plate of spaghetti? Even if the pasta is handmade (and I don't think it is) that's crazy. The wine list is pretty ok, but this isn't the only place in Pittsburgh to drink wine, and I can guarantee you that anywhere else you choose would have better food. I'd probably be more forgiving of the lack-luster menu if it weren't for other factors. Because the real downfall at Pino's is the owner, Joe. This man has no tact, no grace--and judging by the food, absolutely no talent in the kitchen. I've been to Pino's a handful of times, as it's near my home, and honestly, I really wanted to like it. But each time I've been in, I'm surprised by the extent of this man's unprofessionalism. He has a very large presence and is very outgoing, but not in the way you want. You'll notice from other reviews that he does not take kindly to criticism. If you don't like something you ordered, keep your mouth shut or be prepared for a debate over the quality of the product. I've even witnessed him making racist comments about his diners--for example, I overheard him one evening saying he was glad that two ""asian"" customers had come in that night, ""because they're good tippers."" I don't know how they didn't hear him, because the dining room isn't that big, and this guy doesn't know how to keep his voice down. That was pretty much the last straw for me. The amount of pride Joe and his staff seem to have in their restaurant is completely disproportionate to the quality of food, and certainly their customer service. Take my advice, don't waste your time here."
"Probably one of the worst places I have been to recently. I have had pasta come out of the freezer that was better prepared. $70 for a mushy rigatoni chicken dish and 2 glasses of wine (incl 20% gratuity.) service was very poor - on our table of 5 server couldn't remember what anyone had for drinks or dinner ever. You need to write down something on your pad like woman in blue del sol/cab sauv to help you, that's fine but don't come back all clueless like you had never heard us order. I won't be going back.  Seating was also poor, I had reservations and walked in before a large party, who was seated before me. Meaning I arrived at the hostess station first, and they took the party behind me before asking me my name. I was not the first, nor the last, to arrive for my party and reservation was in my name."
"I normally love Pinos. I'm a member of their Diners  Club, live 2 blocks away and often walk there with my dog and eat outside. They are very dog friendly. However, this evening I sat at the bar planing to order wine and dinner. While the bartender did give me a wine list, she then proceeded to ignore me, more interested in chatting it up with the couple at the end of the bar. After 5 minutes, I left. I thought the days of ignoring and disrespecting solo female diners were behind us. I went to Park Brugge where the service at the bar with Amanda is always top notch!"
"Had very bad experience with this auto-shop. My car's engine stalls at idle and coolant temperature is not right. When make turns, there is noise from front wheel. This garage took more than a week to diagnose my car and gave me a ~1900$ bill for repair of a lot of un-related stuff. And they didn't even check the cooling system until I ask them to do. Then they insisted nothing wrong with cooling system other than a loose clamp, which is not loose at all. And they claim all my car's problems will be fixed. They took another week to finish the job and the next morning after I got my car, my engine stalls twice within 20 minutes, coolant temperature is still wrong and front wheel noise is still there. Sent my car back and they said another 500$ to replace several sensors will fix the problems, which is non-sense. I will never trust them anymore and nether should you. They only trick you to do repairs you don't need and never fix a real problem."
"Definitely overpriced for what they offered.  Took my car in to check my AC, they didn't get back to me for the whole day, and decided to fix whatever the problem was without asking me and charging me an insane about (approximately $150 more than most places).  Definitely will not go back there again."
"Been yelled at by other customers (today for instance)...place is super ghetto...avoid at all cost. Today, left a full cart bacause a woman (with a baby in a stoller) shouted at me for ""cutting in line"". Will never go back. At night it is a nightmare."
"Never Again. My friend and I went into this Giant Eagle for a ""quick trip"" to pick up some chips and such before going to a party. Took us three minutes to find some chips. We stood in line to check out for about half an hour. It was like a window into hell. The line was for ""express,"" there was only one ""express"" line and there was only one slow checker. I will never step foot in that store again. I'm relatively new to the area and am told this store is referred to as ""the dirty bird."""
Came to this location for a quick run in and I regret it immensely.  Decided to get a Giant Eagle card since my item was on sale.  The clerk at Customer Service was so rude I took my ID back and walked away.  Her language was impossible to understand and when I didn't understand her second mumbling she yelled her question at me.  This happened twice.  They won't ever see me here again.
"Figure I'd give Supercuts a shot since Giant Eagle sells their gift cards so it is great for fuelperks.  I don't remember her name but she is one of the ""bigger"" woman there.  I wanted to grow out my hair longer but it was looking messy.  So I asked her for a trim to get the sides/back cleaned up.  She said ok and off she goes.  5 minutes later, we were done.   Yes, just like a bad date, we were done in 5 minutes.I got home, showered, and saw the damage.  It was messy.  What's worst is every day it grows, it looked even worst.I'll just stick to my usual barber."
"Terrible! I got a haircut here once and hated it, but kept waiting for it to settle in after a few washes. It never did look right, so I just fixed it at home rather than going back to these incompetent people. I didn't even feel like the hassle of complaining was worth it, as I highly doubted that I'd get any money refunded and I certainly didn't want them to touch my hair again to try to fix it. I then figured, hey, this place sucks for haircuts but they can't mess up eyebrow waxing, right? Right! But their service is so bad that I gave up on that too -- I got my eyebrows done here a few times with not much trouble, but the last time I went in, I had called ahead to put my name in and was told that I would be next on the list, and to show up in about 20 min. My house is a 20 min walk from there, perfect! I headed out, got there in 20 min, and gave the woman at the desk my name and reminded her I'd called ahead. There was one man sitting there waiting, who I had seen from across the street walking in about 1 min ahead of me. The ""stylist"" was just finishing up a haircut, so I should have been next, right, since I had put my name in before the guy who walked in? Nope! She called him over and I said ""sorry, I think I was next, I called ahead and was told I'd be next in line"" and the lady said ""oh we don't do that."" WTF?? You told me very clearly that you do exactly that, what craziness is this? So I waited, figuring that I'd already invested 20 min into this venture, so I may as well stick it out. And waited, and waited, while one ""stylist"" cut the man's hair and 2 of them chatted in the back (ironically next to the chair where they do facial waxing). They must have been ""on break,"" or maybe just terribly rude and idiotic, because I sat there waiting for another full 20 min, and when I finally spoke up again to ask when someone would be available to do my eyebrows. The 2 chatty cathies in the back looked over, very annoyed at my presence, and the woman doing the haircut said ""after I'm done here,"" and I sat there incredulous for another 2 minutes before getting up and leaving. Will never go back."
I went there today! The cut was terrible! I have an awful experience. They lady that cut my hair was nice but she wanted to leave early so she made a disaster in my head!
Tasteless food that arrived over an hour after it was ordered and was cold.  Will never order from here again.
"Never received my order and was left in a bad mood. The driver did not carry GPS for delivery, did not know my address which is right in squirrel hill, did not listen to me (or did not understand me?) when I tried to give him directions, asked me to pick up food from an intersection 0.3 miles away from my apartment in snow, and finally yelled at me to cancel my order. Cannot comment about food, but whatever experience I had left a bad taste."
"-3. Food arrived 2 hrs late. The delivery driver was the guy from the pizza place next door and didn't know anything about the order. Food was luk-warm when it arrived. The food was completely inedible. The sweet and sour chicken was DISGUSTING. It was a neon pink color and tasted like dried out chewy dog food. Beef tasted like it was bad and honestly I nearly puked after the first mouthfull. The only thing that was edible was the rice, which was average at best. There's $20 down the drain. Never again."
"Worst in Pittsburgh. Just got the MooGooGai Pan with Hot/sour soup which is one of my regulars. I read on here that they have a $10 minimum so I ordered some fried wontons to make up the difference. I was charged $14 because I didn't say ""lunch special"" when the size I was given was obviously lunch sized. The wontons were horrible dry crackers with a marble sized price of ""meat"" inside. No dipping sauce with the wontons. Hot/soup was bland was so small I thought it was my dipping sauce. Opened up my Moo Goo and it was mostly broccoli and zucchini. Almost no chicken. Got an extra fortune cookie though!I will not be eating here again. Total disappointment."
"I wish there was a zero star option to give. This may be some of the worst ""Chinese"" I've ever been delivered. First off, everything was dripping everywhere. The entire bag was a soggy mess. Then we get to the chicken chow mein. I'm not even sure they bothered to cook that. My boyfriend couldn't even look at it once taking a bite, it made him sick. Next up, the ""general tso's bean curd."" Under cooked and not properly drained of any water. I don't know what that sauce was made from but it was disgracing all General Tso's sauce by existing. The egg rolls, a Chinese classic, were so dark and hard, I'm not sure how we could have possibly eaten them. The Crab Rangoon's... Generally these are my favorite thing at a Chinese restaurant. I'm not sure what they think they are attempting to pass for Crab Rangoon's here. These monstrosities were completely inedible. The only thing they didn't mess up on our order was the rice. It tasted and looked like rice. When we called to complain I was told the restaurant said they did nothing wrong and wouldn't do anything about the situation. Awesome. Now my stomach is upset from the few bites I took.I'm pretty sure this place should change it's name to ""Inedible Slop"" because it's far from ""Tasty."""
"Bleh. I've tried a lot of pizza places and this is so bad. The crust is not homemade, pretty sure. I saw them take it out of a plastic bag, and it sure tastes yuck. It wasn't very hot either. I am definitely going elsewhere next time."
"We were visiting from out of town and just spent 6 hours driving. Found this place, read reviews on Yelp which were OK, and decided to ordered two slices. Hum...sorry not slices. More like two squares of cheesy bread. When we said these aren't slices, the lady at the register looked confused as though pizzas always look like that. We obviously aren't locals by the way we were dressed so the lady (who talked terribly) should have notified us when we first ordered it! They also have pictures of real pizzas on the wall -_-It also took a really long time to cook those little things because they weren't pizzas. Since I was so hungry, i ordered another square of unhappiness and it was handed to me in the cooking wrapper not a paper plate, ugh. Definitely never going there if we come to visit again!"
"This place has the worst service I've ever seen. I called in two cold sandwiches and was told it would be 15 mins. When I got to the counter, the lady working rudely told me to wait for my name to be called because she didn't have my ticket to ring up the order. Um, okay...then walk over and get it so i can pay for it! So I waited and waited as people who came in long after me got their orders. The ""workers"" just stand around and spend more time talking to the regulars and trying to act like they are a big deal. I had to leave without my order after 40 minutes. DO NOT GO HERE!"
"Used to be the ""staple"" of the community years ago, before Home Depot. My mom, uncles, aunts and even grandparents would grab a bite here ever since I can remember. On a trip home, pregnant and all, I went to visit and was extremely disappointed. I ordered a chicken salad,  picked it up, drove 15 mins to my family home only to discover that there was NO chicken in my chicken salad!!! Wtf. When I called, the guy who answered was already anticipating my call,  I assume because before I could explain to him the error,  he stated ""yup!"" and pretty much ended the call. I debated for several moments whether or not to return, but my little one made the decision for me. When I returned,  I thought I'd at least be offered a pop for my troubles,  or even a hear felt apology for the inconvenience...nope. My chicken was placed on top of the salad and the young girl at the register offered me an additional ranch dressing, for my trouble.  ""Wow"" is all I could muster up. What happened to the Ventos that was once nestled between Fox's bar and the cleaners, in front of Sears...or the one on the corner,  across from that single apartment building? Now, like everything else in East Liberty, this once regarded community staple is quickly transitioning to the gentrified community of tomorrow,  all fluff and no substance. Out with the old (school), in with the new, literally.  I hate that ish..."
Worst pizza I have had in my entire 40 years of life. Tasted like sauce and cheese on toast. Frozen pizza is better than their pizza. I wouldn't eat this pizza if it was free.
"Hands down, Minutello's is overpriced cafeteria food. Olive Garden seems like fine dining compared to this place. You can already tell how bad your experience is going to be when they give you the complimentary bread that looked like it was bought from a convenience store. Not the crusty Italian bread. The generic Giant Eagle whole wheat bread that I buy regularly tasted 10x better. This so-called Italian bread came with pre-packed airline butter. No dipping oil with herbs and spices. Then we had the wedding soup which looked like it's been sitting in the kitchen since this morning and was just reheated. We had the appetizer platter, which was composed of allegedly banana peppers, calamari, and breaded zucchini. It was 95% breading. I can barely taste any calamari or zucchini. The worst was the marinara sauce, which tasted like it came from a can. Again, no herbs and spices. For the entree, I ordered rigatoni and my fiance had baked ziti. The only way I can describe the sauce is: Think of diluted Ragu. My pasta was also overcooked and there was no flavor whatsoever so I had to put so much parmesan cheese. I couldn't even taste garlic in it. What kind of Italian food has no garlic? The baked ziti was overcooked and dry, and it was tasteless according to my fiance. Service was slow, but there was only one waitress in the restaurant. I requested warm water and it took about 40 minutes until she finally served it. She was generally nice and probably embarrassed for serving such crappy food.How much did it cost us? $50, including tip.This restaurant was probably good back in the day. As we left the place, we saw a certificate of excellence for being one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. In 1993."
"This Shell station is horrible.1) The bathrooms aren't inside, like Getgo's. They're outside and around this sketchy corner, filthy dirty with gang signs and cigarette butts littered on the floor.2) The store itself is tiny and cramped with many items out of stock and 3-4 people who work *one* register.3) The parking lot itself is pitted and dangerous, even by Pittsburgh Pothole standards.4) This place is ghetto. This is the place all of the thugs and gangsters come to get their Slim Jims and ""hang out"". People paid for things in nickles and pennies.That was my first experience at the store. My second experience (months later -- I blame a lapse in memory) found me driving down Baum and thinking ""hey, I could use gas and my car is crazy dirty. I wonder how much that Shell place's car wash is? It won't be so bad if I never have to go inside the store."" So I google-texted real quick and called them. After 8 rings someone picked up the phone and mumbled at me. I cheerfully asked how much the car wash was. -""We can't give that information over the phone"". --""Wait, what!? Why not?"" ""I just want to know to compare it to Getgo's, which is $7"". -""Sorry."" --""Well that's stupid; let the manager know I think he's an idiot."" -""Sure"". Click.So come for the ebola laced bathroom, stay for the nihilistic attitudes!"
"Be careful paying with cash here. I coughed up the $12 cash I had in my pocket, went out to the pump. After attempting to pump gas, and getting maybe a pint, it just stopped working. I had to wait in line again to get to the counter. After waiting, they told me it had pumped. We went round and round, with their solution being that they could print me a receipt, and I could come talk to the manager about it. This was %100 unacceptable, but there wasn't much to do about it in the face of their utter indifference. Zero effort, and a horrible attitude. I've had a history of not great experiences here, and that's saying a lot. It's a gas station, how hard can it be? It's clear that they do not care at all. This past incident just seals it. I'm never going back, and you shouldn't either."
"Horrible experience. I was rear ended at a stop sign, wasn't my fault. Mikes did the repairs, poorly. Trunk lines off, bumper lines off, wires for taillights hanging, rear header panel was pushed in from the accident. Taillights pushed out after accident. Mikes didn't repair any of these issues. Even after I had told them during the estimate. Also found chips dumped out on the passenger side floor. They are truly an express shop. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone."
"Please do not adopt any pets from here until they update their standards.  I hate to think of animals living in cages, but...!! At least two cats adopted from here in September have diagnosed with the herpes virus by the vet, and this is contagious to other cats. !!AKA, it is likely that the shelter staff is not washing hands between handling pets and they are not testing for a virus that can be fatal in kittens.I recently adopted a kitten from their shelter--I picked him up from their Pittsburgh Public Market adoption station.  I was told that he had been tested for common feline viruses and up-to-date on vaccinations.  These were both untrue statements.  The kitten has the herpes virus and was not vaccinated against this.  My roommate, who was with me, and I were warned about the upper respiratory infection (URI) that can occur because of this virus and others, but we were not told that he was neither tested nor vaccinated for the herpes virus.  They gave me a paper with his vaccinations, but it was in vet-speak, so I took their word for it. Furthermore, the shelter staff put my kitten in my roommate's name mistakenly (and claimed that if we just called in that they would fix this mistake, but then wouldn't), so when he got sick, no one from their clinic would return my calls--I'm guessing this was since I wasn't the owner according to their records.  I had to email them to get a response, which basically said sorry that we didn't return your calls but this is your problem now.  They never apologized for the kitten's health or asked if he was feeling better.  Where's the compassion for the animal?So now I have a very sick kitten on my hands.  I took him to the Big Easy in Lawrenceville when he stopped eating, and Dr. Ruiz is the best.  She took care of him, but it cost $160 to treat the virus he picked up at the shelter.The Animal Rescue League shelter/clinic said that it does not and will not cover expenses for this.  After I had already taken him elsewhere, the clinic staff said that they would have given me a discount if I had waited two days to go to their clinic, but who would wait two days while the kitten wouldn't eat??  And now this virus makes him ineligible for pet insurance.  It  will cost hundreds of extra dollars a year to keep him healthy. Had I not fallen in love with the little monster, I would have taken him back to another shelter.  That's what the person who adopted the other kitten with virus did.  Whenever he gets an outbreak, he will get another URI.  This means a lethargic cat who sneezes, gags, and coughs because he can't breathe and who won't eat because he's too congested to smell his food.  It's very sad--protect your cats with the herpes vaccination, please!Oh, and in case you were wondering: just like in humans, cat herpes is fo' life.  Poor little guy.  This also ruins my plan of getting another cat in the future.  Bad shelter!"
"Staff members here have always come up short. A past kennel worker  sold his litter of pit bull puppies in east liberty and the shelter was made aware of it  but excused it. They will lie to surrendering families because they don't  want the cold hard truth, the good, bad and the ugly to leak out to the public. They lie ! They kill many many animals because of a very subjective behavioral test that their dog hating staff performs .They kill more pets for space than any other pittsburgh shelter.Many volunteers walk on eggshells here because they know an animals life is hanging in the balance and they are afraid to speak up or not allowed back in to volunteer . Weak leadership. This is the cities highest cat and dog death rate of any shelter or rescue in western pa"
"This is a terrible shelter.  It appears that they routinely turn away (or kill, unless you state you will take them back) cats because they are ""overcrowded.""  They will tell you that your cat has a "" behavioral issue"" to address turning said animal away. Mark that you will take your cat (or dog, etc.) back or else you risk having them ""put down."""
"They did my dogs neutering surgery and they did not do it correctly, which resulted in it opening the next day. The listed emergency number did not answer and when I did get ahold of them I was immediately told it would be at least $160 to have him seen. I had to take him somewhere else get him seen and then back to the animal rescue league to it done right. My poor baby went through hell. Never again will I take my dog there."
"There are a bunch of pretentious self ritiuos self entitled ass clowns. The pious smiles on those stupid faces was only topped how they were too busy to find my dogs stollen colllar. I left my dog in my car for less then 30 minutes, in the shade with the windows down and some strumpet called 911 and animal control takes my dog to this ""shelter"" who then charged me $90 to get her back, on top of losing her colar. Then they treat me I'm a villian because the reporting woman said the dog wasin the car in the sun with the windows up for over 2 hours. I guess they trust total freak show losers more than their owners.I literally rescued this dog from the woods in Texas (a kill on site state), she was 12 lb, starving, scared, and looked like a skeleton. She was sick six ways to sunday. I spent $2000 dollars getting her healthy, and got kick out of my apartment which didn't allow pets. Then spent another $1000 dollars when she got a punchured lung at a dog park . This, all for a dog I found in the woods. Do you really thing I'm going to lock it in a car to die? Am I really a villian? The crew at that ""shelter"" need to check their attitudes before treating people like Michael Vick.OH YEA! When I asked if there was another option besides paying this outrageous bill, the uncaring bearded rope-pusher casually said ""we euthanize, or put up for adoption, yours we would euthanize"".... I hate that place and everyone in it."
"This guy isn't a tailor. He's a butcher. Seriously, . . . I brought in two suits. I got them back two weeks and $250 later. The pants were an solid inch short of the top of my shoes! I've had twenty or more suits professionally tailored in the course of my career and I've never said anything other than 'generous break'.  The pants fit on the middle of my hips and the crotch fit like a bad bicycle seat. The coat had the oddest roll I've ever seen, diagonal from shoulder to waist. It was SO BAD that I didn't even take it back to complain as lacked any confidence whatsoever that he could fix it. Took everything across town and for less than $30 they were able to work with the pants. But there was not enough fabric left in the coat to offer any help. Bad. Really bad."
"Never again. Let me repeat, never again. The primary reason I used to visit this store was to fill medical prescriptions. Due to their repeated inability and ineptness in fulfilling simple requests, I cannot continue to patronize this store.Walking into the store, you are given the stink-eye by a minimum wage security guard, which automatically gives you as a customer the warm and fuzzy ""guilty-until-proven guilty"" feeling a shoplifter would get, which is what this store assumes everyone is based upon their decision to lock up the mouthwash and shampoo.The pharmacy seems to be staffed by high school interns.  They have no concept of customer service, nor do they display any attention to detail, which is quite frankly frightening in a pharmacy.  I really think my chihuahua would make a better pharmacist than the people who work here - my chihuahua lick you to death before you got your prescriptions, but at least you'd get greeted when you approach the counter, and you'd get what you ask for.The first mishap was when my wife and I changed prescription insurance providers.  i handed wanna-be pharmacist #1 my new insurance card.  After spending about 5 minutes staring into a computer screen behind the counter, he assured me that they had my insurance information in the computer.  I then returned in the following days to fill a prescription, trusting in what wanna-be pharmacist #1 had told me in the days prior.  When I went to check out the bill came to over $300, which I chalked up ""maybe I have to meet a deductible before the coverage kicks in.""  Upon further research, we discovered that wanna-be pharmacist #1 had NOT updated my insurance information and had run the numerous prescriptions I filled under my old insurance.The latest of many ""adventures"" involved my wife calling in a prescription refill.  We stopped to pick it up on the way home from work, only to be told when we arrived that the insurance won't cover the refill until tomorrow.  Again, she CALLED and SPOKE to one of them to refill the prescription before showing up.  I guess it's too much to ask to TELL someone you're speaking to on the phone that they need to wait a day for the insurance to work before coming into a ghetto pharmacy to not pick up a prescription.  But hey, at least wanna-be pharmacist #2 behind the counter was dressed like a stripper, which gave me and my wife some comic relief for the moment.  We then returned the following day to (again) pick up the prescription we called to have refilled 2 days prior.  We were first told by wanna-be pharmacist #3 that there weren't any prescriptions waiting for us.  After searching around for a few minutes, they ""found"" my wife's prescription refill, but it would take 10 minutes to be ready.  Yes, the prescription that we tried to pick up yesterday would need another 10 minutes to be prepared.  Hence, I am now here, writing this review.Never, ever again."
"Tire replacement, was told it would take about 1.5 hours (when I had an existing appointment). It's almost been 2.5 hours and I'm still waiting. Ridiculous."
"I experienced three main issues with this Goodyear location while purchasing/installing a new set of tires:-They did not have my name or appointment in their system when I showed up. Fortunately, they still honored my appointment. -They did not install tires correctly. Left for a business trip the following day, and once I got on the highway and my speed passed 65 mph, the car began to rattle (with my new ""comfort tread"" tires). Booked an appointment, and they fixed the issue.-Two months later, I went to my Toyota dealership for routine maintenace. The dealer mechanic found that the lugnuts on the tires had been over torqued by Goodyear. So the Toyota mechanic had to saw them off of each tire and replace them with non-security locked nuts. (If I had a flat on the side of the road, I would have been SOL).All of these issues were entirely preventable. The lack of expertise and techincal skill at this Goodyear location is abysmal. I do not recommend."
"I was just there this morning for a 10am appointment to get my summer tires swapped out for my winter tires.  My regular mechanic was overbooked and there is snow coming on Monday.  Receptionist scheduled me in just fine and the quoted price was reasonable, so I said OK.  Upon arrival, store manager stated that they will not touch the car as it has aftermarket rims and lug nuts.  He did not state any restrictions about aftermarket parts as they could not guarantee the work.  I asked if this was the case for all rims and he became a little snotty.  I had heart surgery a while back and I can't do the jack and tire work as not to tear at my incision/breastplate, if this was not the case with my health, I'd certainly take care of it.  Aftermarket rims are common - should not be an issue.  Last time I ever set foot in that place."
"I went in for new tires and a routine oil change. When I called about my car's status after many hours, I was told that the machine they use to pump the oil malfunctioned and motor oil got all over my car's engine! They said it shouldn't be a problem since they cleaned the engine bay, but when they brought my car out, my check engine light was on. They went to clear the light, but it came back on again. I was told to bring my car in the next day and they will look into the problem. On my way home, my engine started smoking profusely. Since my check engine light was on, I stopped at a local garage to get it checked out. They looked at my engine for me and told me that Goodyear must have spilled a TON of motor oil on my engine which caused it to smoke like crazy. The mechanic also pulled up the check engine light code (Goodyear did not tell me when I asked them about the code when I picked up my car), which said that my oxygen sensor was malfunctioning. The oxygen sensor in my car is connected right to the exhaust manifold and it was clear from visual inspection that oil has gotten all over it.I went back to Goodyear the next day, they took my car in and I waited for over an hour in their lounge. No one came out to tell me what they were doing to fix my car or if they were taking responsibility for the faulty sensor. I finally had to asked the desk clerk, who told me that they were going to replace the sensor and I should come back later. Goodyear did replace the oxygen sensor free of charge. They never apologized for the oil spill; no one talked me through what they were doing during the repair. I will not be returning in the future."
"Poor service that leaves tenants to fight mildew on their own. When asked to repair something, Rockwel Realty will do it on their terms and refuse to give you notice of when they will enter your apartment despite multiple requestsWhen asked to clean mildew, they did in fact clean it with bleach while also spilling bleach on my sheets and ruining them. When told about this problem and that the mildew returned they said it was my fault for not turning the heat up and that damage done during service is an inherent risk the tenant is responsible for and nothing could be done. Their solution was for me to clean the mildew instead of properly insulating the unit to prevent mildew. The entire building also has severe electrical problems that causes all lights to be replaced twice a month. No permanent fixes are made to existing units, but there is constant construction to expand an old building so they can collect more rent."
I am blown away by the code violations in this unit. The tenants said they have reported these issues to the owner and to no avail. I am hoping to direct these tenants to a lawyer in PA.
"Some things are a blessing in disguise--such as the time I attempted to relocate to Pittsburgh and found a somewhat decent apartment in the North Side.  I took a tour of the place.  I was hopeful the cat smell would be addressed but when the guy said ""Oh, you can smell that?"" I should have known then.  The apartment needed painted--badly, but I was willing to deal so that the stress of relocation could go away.  The unit also had no window treatments, no air conditioning, and did I mention the cat smells?  On a Friday, I told them I was interested in the apartment, they told me to mail my security deposit check that day.  I followed direction and mailed it.  I made plans for moving.  They never called to tell me my rent check wasn't recieved on Saturday or the following Monday.  I had to email them to request a copy of my lease when I was told  ""The apartment is no longer available, someone came in today and gave a security deposit"".  Interesting--so when I asked the office that past Friday they told me not to bring in my check--that mail would suffice.  Something doesn't sound right here.  Their lack of communication also cost me an additional $100 in non-refundable moving expenses as I had put down a deposit with a moving company.  Definately one of the more frustrating things to happen to me during my relocation, but based off the condition the apartment was in, coupled with these poor reviews, I should be counting my blessings."
"The people who work here are very rude. I have gone back a few times thinking it may have just been the person working that day was just a rude person, but no it happen every time. I am not a young hip person and felt very out of place there. It is like you are walking into someone's house and bothering them. The people working behind the counter act like you are interfering with there conversation. Plus it is very dirty. Perhaps the people working there should try cleaning the place instead of talking to each other. I will not go back again."
"I used to be all about this place before I moved to New York, so I was excited this morning when I decided to get coffee for my girlfriend and I. Seriously, fuck this place. I came in, and everyone gave me the once over, and I get the brooding barista act, but as a patron and someone who has worked in the service industry, I feel like there definitely should be some sort humanesque emotion displayed from these people. All three behind the counter looked at me like I had ten eyes and dicks for eyebrows. I asked for Iced Skim Latte, got a hot one, but hey, small fuck up. It was the exasperated sigh when I corrected them, I could've fucking done without. Still didn't get an iced skim latte. Also, when I point to something and use the proper name of it, I feel like it shouldn't be a problem for an individual of average intelligence. I ordered an apple dumpling, pointed to the apple dumpling, and thought I was watching them put it in there, until I turned my head for a second, and got a fucking Danish. It wouldn't have been a big fucking deal, IF THEY WERENT FUCKING DICKS THE ENTIRE TIME I WAS THERE. Yeah, five out of five stars, definitely gonna go again and right my next screenplay."
"This is the worst service (or worst non-service) I have ever experienced. Since I can't give zero stars, I'm giving the service one. We didn't eat anything so I can't comment on the food. My husband and I went to Buffalo Blues last night. We stood at the empty hostess stand for a while. When no one came to seat us, and we couldn't find anyone to seat us, we seated ourselves figuring that's what we were supposed to do.The bar was full, but not packed. There were only two other tables with guests, one of which had empty plates on the table during this entire experience. After what seemed like forever, my husband got up to find a server. He literally walked around the restaurant to find someone, but couldn't. He then tried to ask the bartender, but she was just as elusive. When he finally found a server,  she acted totally shocked that we were there. Maybe if someone had been doing their job, they wouldn't be surprised to find hungry people in a restaurant.She came to our table, got our drinks (a soda and a water) and asked us if we were ready to order. When we said no she said she would be back. We could see her chit chatting with another server, but again, couldn't get her attention to come back to take our order. After another ten minutes of waiting for her to return, we put a few dollars on the table for my soda and we left. We ordered a pizza at a local shop and picked it up on our way home.Twenty-five minutes passed and we only get drinks? Such a waste of time. It took us 20 minutes just to make the drive there, 25 of waiting, and another 20 to get home. That's over an hour of our evening completely wasted which left us starving after a hard days work. I used to work as a server so I could understand if the place was busy and the staff was short handed, but it was basically a dead night table top wise. I will NEVER go back."
"I hate this place. I have been here many times and I am just finally getting around to writing a review.  Let me state that my wife made me go here tonight because my friends wanted to and she said I need to indulge their interests. Even if they suck. Buffalo Blues is like a Hooters, except the girls where more clothes and are not as good looking. The service is horrendous and the food may be better at Hooters.  The beer selection is decent at Buffalo Blues but it is expensive and they often run out of things that are still on the board.My friends like going for all you can eat wing night but frankly I don't get it. You get 10 wings up front they will give more wings 5 at a time. The problem is that you get those wings in 30 minute intervals.  So the max you could eat is 55 wings. Did I mention that  the wings are really tiny and the sauce is tossed on like a Jackson Pollack painting.  They also charge extra for blue cheese or ranch.  The wings do not come with celery. This is a crime against humanity and the city of Buffalo.  I chose to detour from wings tonight and ordered a chicken sandwich. Apparently this was a bad choice.  It took a full hour to get my food. It was so long that the rest of the table ate their wings and ordered more and the waitress didn't think this was a problem. When my meal did arrive everything was cold. The sandwich was ok, but the fries were just tiny pieces that were limp and flavorless.I paid $16 for a beer and a sandwich that my friends had to wait for me to eat to leave.  I would say I won't go back, but apparently I like my friends more than I like good food and service."
"Went here this past Saturday afternoon, 11/2. My friends and I sat at the pretty much empty bar for over 5 minutes with no service. The bartender walked by us a few times and didn't even acknowledge we were there. As we walked out, we saw the bartender on the phone and other staff members standing in the back chatting. We went next door to Mad Mex and got much better service!"
"To be honest, I think this is one of the worst bars in the entire city.  The food was sub-par, even for bar food, the service was awful, especially during a game. I do enjoy a good sports bar, but I think the thing I hated most about this place was the other people that frequent there. It's the quintessential Shadyside bar, equipped with doughebag bros that went to the same fraternity in college and the Jersey Shore bimbos who pine for them. The last time that I went there were two guys throwing up outside of the bar on the sidewalk. I fully admit this is a subjective review, because this bar was obviously not my scene- but I still do not like this place at all."
"Unfortunately, the service we were given ruined our overall experience at Buffalo Blues. We sat down and put in our drink order.  My husband was excited about the amount of beers they had on tap. Fifteen minutes later and still without drinks, we saw our server trying to hunt the bartender down. Once the bartender finally started working on our drinks, she realized the keg for the beer my husband ordered was tapped. We were sitting at the booths right next to the bar but instead of the bartender just telling us so we could make another decision and get our drinks as soon as possible, she waited for the waitress to come back to tell her. Then, the waitress came back and did not apologize at all but simply said that he had to pick a different beer because they were out of that one. Anyway, long story short, it took way too long to get drinks and there was never any recognition from the staff of the issue. The restaurant seemed poorly managed and subpar. We will not be back."
"Watched a bartender serve a guy a beer when he was visibly intoxicated. He was swaying in circles on the chair next to me. I told the manager about it and he told me ""that guy is just crazy, I've seen him much worse"" so I guess that makes it ok. Made this paying customer leave after one beer."
Dr. Eric Segal was a complete ass. He was rude and obnoxious to me and my wife. We went to him for an adjustment and I left wanting to adjust this idiot's face. I will deter all of my clients from going here and will personally make sure that this man doesn't disrespect anyone else like he did to us.
Made an appointment for 3:30. They completely forgot I was coming but said they could start on my car in ten minutes and be done in an hour. Came back an hour later only to see my car in the same spot. They said it would take another two hours to start work. Completely unhelpful and unapologetic.
"I came in with a flat.  They said they couldn't repair the tire because there was cracking on the edges.  True there were cracks, but they were hairline cracks and superficial.  The diagnosis was done just from examining the exterior, which I discovered, is not sufficient to adequately judge if the cracking is bad enough--you have to actually take the tire off.Coincidentally, all four tires had the light cracking and therefore all four tires would probably need replacing.  Hmmm....  How convenient for Monro?Well, even if I give them the benefit of the doubt on the tire cracking, the pricing on the tires was ridiculous.  My tires, which were under warranty, would have cost over $500 to get replaced with crap tires (that's with the warranty credit applied).  Oh but wait, they could make me a deal with some in-house tires that were even crappier for $480.  How did I know they were crappy?  I looked them up online.  Guess what else I found.  Both sets of tires were significantly cheaper according to the Manufacturer's website even when including installation, balancing, and disposal!  So no, no thank you.  I don't want to pay $500 to get cheap tires on my car.Fortunately, my tire would hold air for a few hours so I drove to another place.  They fixed the flat no problem for $20.  Guess that cracking wasn't so bad after all."
"I came in here to have a diagnosis done on my car because the ABS light was on. They removed all the tires, showed me how the sensor and ABS work, did not perform the diagnosis I originally went in for and told me that I should have the back wheel hubs replaced for a total of $1,222, this with a new set of breaks (that I knew about) and ""without"" charging me labor. I may not know much about cars but I know how to search the internet and ask for advice. I found the cost of wheel hubs, they are no more than $150 each (for my car) and here they said that they cost $550 each (before labor). I also found out that the sensors get so soiled from all the dirt and salt that most of the time all the car needs is a simple wash on the undercarriage. You should always have your car washed, specially in the winter. It may save you $100's.This place will rob you blind.Never have work done in a place like this until you do your homework!"
"I took a subaru outback here for the annual state safety and emissions inspections.  First I was charged more for this service than what was clearly posted on the service station wall.  Secondly I was failed for a lug nut that had rusted to the point that the technicians could not get it off.   I was quoted $425 for them to get it off.  I was able to accomplish this with a $6 bottle of penetrating oil and a breaker bar.  When I returned to have the reinspection I was charged for it (their policy posted on the service wall clearly states you get a second inspection within 30 days of initially failing free of charge).  This time they were able to get the lug nut off but supposedly could not get it back on.  This was odd as I had taken it off and put it back on numerous times to ensure it was okay to pass.  They once again quoted me $425, stating they would have to replace the wheel stud.  The new wheel stud cost me $3.50 at the local parts store and I did the job in under an hour without a single power tool.  This shop is not following the guidelines they have clearly posted on their wall and are fabricating problems in an effort to overcharge you for simple repairs.  Avoid this shop."
"Have taken my car here a few times because there's a bus stop out front so it's convenient to drop my car off and get to work. But after what happened I will never be back. They just cost me money and lost my tires. In March I blew a tire on a pothole (naturally) and they replaced the two front tires for me. The second tire was fine but you have to replace both, I kept it so that I would have a spare if another one blew out. Put the tires in my basement, no problem. Saved for a rainy day. This week I ran over a nail and the tire wasn't fixable so I had to get it replaced. Luckily I've got a spare! I called Monro early this morning to see if I could get in but they said it would be tomorrow at the earliest. I needed my car so I took it to pep boys (three hour turnaround - also the last time I needed an oil change they said they were booked for three days, good lord). I drop the car off at Pep Boys and tell them the extra tire is in the back. They call me up and tell me the tire is the wrong size. What? Monro gave me the wrong tires back when they replaced them in March. So I had to buy a new tire when I had a perfectly good one that is now god knows where. The tire was the wrong size and definitely didn't come from my car as it wouldn't have fit on the rim. After paying for the tire at Pep Boys I went over to Monro to see what they would do about it. They informed me that because I already had the new tire put on they couldn't do anything but the next time I came in they ""would work with me"". Why the hell would I come back when you just screwed me out of a hundred bucks and a good tire? Not worth chancing. Because you couldn't fit me in within a day I get screwed? If you need tires go to Pep Boys on Milvalle. If you need an oil change go to Midas on Penn Circle they'll be able to get you in and not wait three days."
"Ah Monro, where ""45 minutes"" is actually 2 hours and running at the time of this post. My car is on a lift with no tires and the employees are smoking cigarettes laughing. I can't even escape if I wanted to. At least they turned the heat off in the waiting room. Not like it's November in Pittsburgh or anything..."
I wish we had a way to hold this corporation accountable for its crimes against our society.
"Please go to the other McDonalds (not too far from here at 120 Penn Cir W).One time while using their drive-thru service, we realized they forgot to add an item on our receipt. We asked how much the real total is and the employee told me, ""like $5.00."" WHAT!?!!?!!  CAN YOU PLEASE USE YOUR REGISTER TO TELL ME HOW MUCH THE ACTUAL TOTAL IS!"
"Prepare to be wowed. High class dining in one of pittsburgh's up and coming hip neighborhoods. I thought I would try some of the world famous cuisine so I pulled up on a Thursday evening. ""GarÌ¤on"" I asked, ""may I try some of your french fried potatoes?"" I was greeted with a crackled mutter as I inched my vehicle forward. I was then treated to a relaxing 15 minute wait as nobody moved in line. Perhaps it was the clientele, a 1992 minivan filled with some savvy locals. Perhaps it was the professional waitstaff, whom I could hear laughing and socializing through my window. Whatever it was, the dining experience was filled with culinary magic and spa-like service. After some deep meditation, I realized that perhaps tonight was not the best night to sample such fine delicacies so I pulled away. I cannot wait to return to this location and try my luck at trying these elusive fries. I highly recommend this palace of excellence."
"I don't expect much from fast food restaurants. But I do expect to be spoken to when I am a paying customer. I just went through the drive-thru at this location and, other than taking my order at the speaker, no one said a word to me. There was a different person at each window, and neither of them said hello, your total is, fuck you, nothing. I don't think I've ever encountered such a miserable bunch of people. Maybe they're upset because their heroin operation was shut down."
"Pro: J.J. Land has many properties in the Highland Park, East Liberty, Shadyside, Friendship area for reasonable rent prices. Think $400.00 (for a 1 bedroom) +.Con: Honestly, 1 star is way tool fair for this con artist of a slumlord. Like the other posters have mentioned, if your rent includes utilities (mainly gas/water), heaven help you. They don't turn on the heat until Dec, and that's only if you complain multiple times. When they decide to turn the heat on, they temperture never rises above 65 degress- you will definitely need to invest in a good electric heater. Hot water, the building that I rented, lost hot water for almost 2 weeks straight- there is no emergency line- so when I needed to call the office I had to leave a voicemail message Saturday night, and I had to HOPE that someone would call me back Monday after 10am. The buildings are ratty and filty. Due to the low cost of rent, also brings scum tenants that bring all types of pests, from roaches to the rats/squirrels in the walls, to bed bugs. After renting from them for a little over a year, I started seeing roaches, I called JJ Land, and they told me they would spray my apartment and set traps. They're not aggressive w/ the treatment of pests- I told them multiple times that they should also treat the entire building. They assured me they would, but that never happened. They are slumlords to the fullest extent- do not sign w/ them, you will be burden w/ all types of unnecessary problems."

"I recently rented from JJ Land for less than one year and while I had few issues during my time living under them, I've come to regret this since I moved.First of all, I have not yet gotten my security deposit back, despite being told it would be put right in the mail a few weeks back.  I'm pretty sure I should have received it by this point if they'd sent it when they said they were going to and no one is returning my calls on the subject.I also need them to send me proof that I paid rent to them for the several months I did and they refused to release such information to me, despite every single month I paid being my individual share and under my own name, because I was not on the lease.  I would be more understanding of this if they didn't offer the alternative solution idea of sending in someone I'd lived with who was or is on the lease to obtain my personal financial records.  And I understand that having no one who can do this for me is my problem and not theirs, this still comes across as very shady business practice.Add this to the fact that my main complaints living in an apartment they managed were continuously losing hot water and faulty electrical outlets they apparently couldn't fix, I would highly recommend going with ANYONE ELSE if you're looking for a new place in Pittsburgh.  Their rent is very reasonable, this is true, but it's honestly not worth it in the end.  Go with Lobos, in all honesty, you'll have better luck."
DO NOT RENT FROM JJ LAND. This company is the most unprofessional and unorganized rental agency I have ever dealt with. I paid $700 for a security deposit and heard nothing back from the office. Every time I called they had lost my pay stubs and application and had no idea what property I was talking about. I told them I would not be renting from them (mind you I never signed a lease or any kind of documentation) and that I wanted my deposit back. They said they would return it however I would be charged an inconvenience fee.. Meanwhile I was the one who was being inconvenienced. Another week passed And I heard not a word from anyone in the office. I finally ending up going into the office and demanding my deposit back. They still have no idea who I was or what property I was talking about. Thank god I kept the receipt. STAY AWAY FROM JJ LAND
"If I could give negative stars I would. After this review, I'm writing the president of AA and if action is not taken to correct the disservice at this location, I will never be a AAA member again. (been one since 1999) I recently moved from TN and needed to transfer my title and register my Dodge Ram in PA.  This process is costly regardless of where you go, but adding $36+ for every transaction makes AAA the most expensive.  I'm willing to pay for people to deal with this inconvenience for me, but AAA has made it worse than going to the DMV.  Each and every clerk at this location is incompetent, uneducated, and aloof. I should know, I've dealt with at LEAST a dozen. Go to the DMV.For my very simple transaction, I've had to return to this location 7 (yes that is SEVEN!) times, and it still is not resolved. They've forgotten to request the title from my lien holder, issued the wrong plate for my vehicle, neglected to inform me of steps required by the state... I mean seriously, why would you pay $36 for EACH visit, just to get it wrong. Go to the DMV!Why did you return there if you were so unhappy, you might ask.  Well once you begin the process at one branch, you cannot transfer to any other branch. (We went to Monroeville to transfer my wife's car and it took 30 minutes, ONCE.) Go to Monroeville, or cancel your AAA membership and go to the DMV!!Oh, and 30 minutes? that's a dream... I'm waited between 45 minutes and 3.5 HOURS at the East Liberty AAA. Prepare to take the day of work... nay, the WEEK in order to complete any transaction at this facility. Go to the DMV!!!!It has now been over 5 months since I started this process and it's still up in the air. they don't know what I still need to do, but they are happy to keep charging me to figure it out.  Save yourself hundreds of dollars and a weeks worth of lost wages and just GO TO THE DMV!!!!!!!! Yeah it might seem sterile and slow, but at least they aren't serial criminals. It'll be over with like waking up from a bad dream, instead of the reoccurring nightmare that is the East Liberty AAA.Oh, and if you think this is a harsh review... Call their number, 412-365-7196. 9 times out of 10 it just rings and rings.. once I timed it for more than 30 minutes before I got an answer (with no apology).  If you are in the AAA, you'll know I'm calling.  It's the constant ring in the background that NOBODY answers."
"I never write reviews... but just had to for this piece of work. I usually blow off overly negative reviews (read prior reviews about this place) assuming they are disgruntled customers looking to whine about something.Well this place has been completely incompetent getting my title transferred from out of state. Weekly calls over 3 months, and now my temporary registration has been expired for a week and they don't know when I'll have legal plates. They promise to call me back right away, and it takes a week. It is just frustrating that these folks are this incapable of completing a simple job. Go somewhere else. Anywhere else."
"I would rather drive out of my way to another Home Depot than give this location my business. Employees are unhelpful and the most of them are too busy talking to each other and complaining about their jobs to notice you're standing there in front of them. Strike that... I'm certain they notice, they just don't care.I'm a pretty understanding person, but when this sort of thing happens more than once on the same visit, it's time to go. There are plenty of HD's around, seek them out and skip this one (especially if you're going to have questions)!"
"What has happened to the East Liberty Home Depot?  It used to be my ""go-to"" place for everything DIY, but no longer.  I stopped by yesterday to pick up about nine items, all of them basic home improvement supplies: cabinet handles, tension rods, quarter round molding, etc.  I came away with NONE of it.  Everything we wanted was OUT OF STOCK!  When I asked if I could order it and have it delivered to the store (to save the shipping costs) I was told that the items I wanted were not ""qualified"" for delivery to the store.  ""When will the items be restocked?""  ""Don't know.""  ""Would it be possible to get the items delivered from another store in the region?""  ""No, that 'messes with' our inventory controls.""  Oh, but I was told I could haul my sorry butt out to Monroeville where the stock of everything I wanted was plentiful.  Really? The staff I dealt with could not have cared less about helping me.  Maybe because it was a holiday (New Year's Eve).  Dunno.  Don't care.  Customer service should not ebb and flow based on the day/date.  The East Liberty HD used to have shelves full of product and plenty of choices.  And the staff was helpful and eager to engage with customers.  No longer.  It appears that the company has given up on the location and is letting it die a slow and painful (for its customers) death.  VERY disappointing to me."
"If you know exactly what you need and won't be asking for any assistance, then any Home Depot is fine. However, if you do need assistance, want to ask questions or take a class, then I recommend going somewhere else, anywhere else really. The customer service at this location is terrible. I once signed up for a class here, and they even had the class written on the board at the front of the store. However, once inside they had no idea and after being handed off to different people, the fifth employee decided to hold an impromptu class just for me, which consisted of him reading the class instructor's manual on the computer and then telling me what it said. I took another trip here to get some lumber and have it cut, and that was an adventure because the employee working in the lumber section had never used the wood cutter equipment. I'd say that 9 out of 10 employees will purposely avoid you or won't be able to answer your question. Now, perhaps it is tough for this location to find knowledgeable employees, but then Home Depot Corp should bring in a better management team and work to improve their employees' customer service skills and content knowledge. As the store stands right now, it appears that Home Depot just does not care, and that's a shame."
Waiting 20 minutes to get one piece of wood cut in an empty store on a Friday afternoon.  Priceless!
"Terrible cashiers here Very rudeThis homedepot is doing a terrible job Never again here"
"Terrible dry cleaners! Poor customer service. I have gone there for convenience sake, but ultimately, I spend more time pointing out their poor quality and returning a second and third time to fix their mistakes than actually saving time. I made the mistake of not inspecting my items at the counter, and when I bring them back the next day, saying that they are still dirty, they have the nerve to make me pay for it again. I will never go there again, and I recommend you don't either."
"They do not take pride in their work.  While clothes are usually cleaned and pressed well, they do not make an effort beyond that.  If you ask them to take out a stain, they don't. Clothes given for repairs or tailoring are done right about half the time, the rest of the time they get lost.  If you ask them to do two things to a garment, that is way beyond them --  will do the hem but not the button, etc.  They also lose things, more than once.  Do not take your clothes there because they will damage or lose them."
"Simply awful!  I dropped off three suits Friday afternoon, and the person who wrote my order was rude, but I brushed it off and chalked it up to a bad day.  As promised, they were ready Monday after 5pm.  I brought them home and was shocked.  The backs of the jackets had the EXACT SAME wrinkles in them that they did when I dropped them off.  Furthermore, there was the EXACT SAME crease in the left sleeve as when I dropped it off.  Additionally, they did not smell so well.  To make matters worse, they just hung the jackets on wire hangers without any cardboard to keep the natural shape of the jackets.  The suits were all custom tailored and not cheap by any stretch of the imagination. I refuse to even let them touch my suits again, let alone any other article of clothing.  I should have read into the clue of the rude employee, but hindsight is always 20/20.  The worst $35.00 I've ever spent.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"
"They've ruined my clothes on 2 separate occasions! I would not have returned had I known before I went to wear what I thought were ""perfectly clean"" clothes from Shadyside Valet. They are Streaky at best!Stay away! They are awkwardly rude in a very nice way. Also they failed to even attempt to remove stains from my clothes, as asked expressly, on two other occasions. I took care of those stains myself. I'm ditching them and calling my bank to get a refund!That placed is cursed! ....Nothing but BAD EXPERIENCES!!! I want you to know I'm not just an ""Angry Customer"". They really do suc!!!!After reading the other review's I have them a "" 1 star""Instead of 2. Giving them one is crime in itself."
"I called to find out if I needed an appointment to which I was told ""just come now we can take you"" then when I gave them my keys they said come back in three hours. Guy was also trying to push a credit card and seemed upset when I said I didn't want one. Three hours later when I came to get my car transaction was processed and he was ready to let me go on till I brought up that The paper said something had been broken on my last oil change. That's funny because between my last oil change and this one I personally checked them oil meter and it was not broken. Furthermore I week later I found my car's belt system was broken. The guy who fixed it said someone must've broken and although I don't agree it's something they could've seen. Not coming back even though it's rather convenient"
"Slow service and response. I've lived in one of the apartments motheral inc manage for more than a year. They were irresponsible for repairing facilities. Our ac wasn't working when we moved in, and they told us it doesn't matter cuz summer is over and it's still not be repaired now. Linda is a quite arrogant woman with bad attitude. Always come without prior notice and leave our doors open. Not recommend."
"This is the greasiest pizza I've ever had in Pittsburgh, I couldn't eat it."
"Provolone sticks arrived undercooked, cheese was fully solid, they tasted okay. The pizza also arrived undercooked, the dough itself was partially uncooked in the middle. I had to put it back into my own oven to finish it off, and then it was greasy and just okay."
"When my boyfriend and I were down with the flu, we ordered some food here through Eat24. I got a chicken noodle soup and he got the seafood calzone. When I unpacked the food and tried a sip of my soup, I found that it was cold and had bubbles in it, as if there was soap in it. I couldn't really taste anything, but my boyfriend said it smelled like dishwater. To say the least, I was disappointed in my soup. When my boyfriend cut into his calzone, he said the cheese was barely melted. We thought it was undercooked and touched the outside. It was cold, as if it was sitting out in the open for a long time. He tried to take a bite, but the dough was barely even cooked and the contents of the seafood calzone was cold and tasted sour.This was our first time ordering from here and it was such a sad experience to have, since our food was inedible. I heard this place was good and had great calzones and tasty soup, but what we received was the complete opposite from the praise I've heard about this place."
"I am not a mean person, not a vindictive person. I bear the friendly people of Pizza Parma no ill will.But their pizza was remarkably terrible.Went there, hungry, a bit past midnight, looking for a little something before going home to sleep. They don't have slices--this seems to be a (terrible, stupefying, egregious) trend in these parts. Fine. The smallest pizza, a ""personal"" pie, costs $7 and is 7"" in diameter. The cashier and I agree that that's a very small amount of pizza, and since I'm hungrier than one and one half mouthsful, I get a ""small,"" which is 10"". I add a mushroom topping. I pay my $11.21 and wait.There are two seating options inside the store: a small wooden bench, and two fold up chairs around a little table. Conveniently, they were using the wooden bench to store a rolled up carpet that laid across the whole thing, and they'd also elected to fold up the two folding chairs, probably because they were tired from a long day of being used as chairs. So I waited outside the store on a bench.The friendly cashier and the friendly patrons waiting for their order indoors called me over when my pizza was ready. I took it outside, sitting in the cold to eat it, thinking, ""I hope this $11 pizza is pretty good."" Opened up the box, saw how pitifully small a 10"" pizza is, and started eating.Let me say something about pizza: if you have decent cheese, decent tomato sauce, flour, water, and a hot oven, you can make a passable pizza. I will eat it and think, ""well this isn't the best pizza I've ever had but it's fine."" That is not what I thought when I ate Pizza Parma's pizza. I thought, ""it would be too rude and insulting to ask for my money back. I'll just try to eat as much of this as I can.""I ate three out of the six ""slices."" (One sixth of a 10"" pizza is a total of *25/6 = 13 square inches. That sounds like a lot of pizza, but in fact is a tiny amount of pizza.) I couldn't stand to eat more than half. The mushrooms were fine; I fished them out and ate them. The cheese was actually terrible; it had a strange chemical taste and plasticky appearance. The crust was poofy and not crusty.Ashamedly, I threw half of a pizza away tonight. Folks, I am not a food destroyer. I eat things I don't like, and expired foods, because I don't want to waste. It takes a legitimately terrible pizza for me to actually throw the thing away.Went home, made some eggs, and guess what? The terrible cheese taste from an hour and a half ago? It's still in my mouth. I'm not making this up.I know there's good pizza around here. Ordered two back to back slices at Spak Brothers--delicious! Tasty! Reasonable price! But whoaaaaaaa whoa was this terrible, overexpensive pizza. Sheesh."
"Terrible pizza. Just plain gross. The crust was all gummy and the cheese tasted like plastic. I would never order their food again. Gross, gross, gross."
"We ordered their supreme pizza (Parma Pizza). It tasted like a frozen pizza, but with less flavor (which is an impressive feat). The crust was hard and flavorless. We also had the chocolate cake. This was a mistake. Avoid this place at all costs."
"When I was a kid my mom took all 6 of us here (ten years ago). Because of that fact I choose this place as an adult. It was AWEFUL! My appointment was at 8:30 am, I was on time. I sat in the waiting room until 9 am. When I asked when I would be seen they seemed to think I was already seen! I waited 30 mins in the lobby. Not cool!"
"I was all set to want to give this place 3 stars simply because another laundry place put me in a bind and this place was open 24 hrs.  I thought the late hours alone should give it a star. Then I had this experience--Poor ventilation I could barely breath its cramped and small with dryers and washers lining two narrow corridors. ---- misleading advertising it boasts ""high capacity"" washers an says its air conditioned, well the air conditioners and vents in the ceiling both were dripping in black dust and look like they were installed in 1963. which might have been why I felt an instant asthma attack coming on. Then the high capacity washers were all of 2.... not great enough to meet demand as it turns out one girl took up both of them while I was waiting. Then another woman waited for hers to wash and took up two again this was at 1030-11:00  pm at night so I can only Imagine what its like to try and get one at other hours. Then there was this guy I guess he was an attendant or the owner, he was wiping down the machines and dryers. I was moving my clothes out of the dryer and I had put my bras hangers and a few shirts on top of my washer. I was literally loading right in the same area and was heading back to grab my things when he touched them!!Ugh laundry violation ya don't touch someone's wet clothes it feels like that time in college when someone would mess with you and dump your clothes behind the washers if you didn't move them out quickly enough. Sooo that pissed me off...... but I have to get the job done so I load up my clothes. I come back in to check on drying clothes.... and what do I find but my dryer mysteriously switched from high heat to low heat. Now I am forced to put in another quarter to finish my load. All in all I spent 8$ at the econowash for 2 large loads I wasn't able to do my third load in the washers he had for under that. I can do that much at Laundry Factory around the corner though. So I will be going there. I don't need a creepy dude changing my dryer settings and touching my stuff."
"Food poisoning a la Tomato Bisque Soup.Forever skeptical.That's too bad, I don't mind paying extra for better produce or better brands. But, I KIND OF mind getting extremely sick, so sick that anything I ever would vouch for goes down the toilet, with my vomit."
"everything is a cluster.  the store.  the parking lot.  the people -- customers included.  full-on cluster. barely any parking for a massive, heavily polluting pick up truck.inside: avocados are the price of gold, and there are no goddamn vegan taco spices at a place that's supposed to be so fancy.  meh.  go to market district where they keep it real.  real classy!!!"
"the parking lot @ this wholefoods is an ABOMINATION!  to compound the issue, whole foods allows their purveyors to park on centre ave (a road that is already miserable enough to drive on) and block traffic. this past monday, a shearer potato chip truck was blocking the right lane. doesn't whole foods have a loading dock? i wrote an email to the district president and he had one of his store minions respond: ""you can park @ walgreens"". sorry, i am shopping @ wholefoods NOT walgreens. translation: whole foods developers were TOO CHEAP to buy the proper amount of real estate. dont even bother coming here fri-sun unless you like a clusterF*** lot full of zombies. this is the 5th WF i have shopped @ (4 in florida) wholefoods should have opened in the south hills. the demographics out there would support it. this wholefoods is BUSH LEAGUE!"
"I have tried Whole Foods recently even after hearing about the attitude of the butthole, hipster employees and presumptuous, bourgeois customers that will literally push you aside a turn their noses up at you a million times. The rumors were true!!! Even though I was only there one time, first impressions are a bitch! The selection is great! I can't afford any of it, but it's great! I have never seen such expensive rice! Here is the bro-down...The food: Plentiful and too expensive to even think of buying. The freshest fish that isn't in the Strip...but you need to take a second mortgage to buy fish for a family. I bought sushi rice, a piece of fish and a salad, my bill: $25! The salad with lettuce, carrots, chick peas, onions and about 5 pieces of chicken was $11+The employees: Hipsters with thick-rimmed glasses, tattoos and facial piercings that slack like I have never seen ""workers"" slack before. In fact there was a sign above some fresh fish stating ""We will prepare you fish any way you want, just ask"" HA...HA! When I asked to have a tiny fish to be filleted (something that would take me about 10 seconds at home) I was scoffed at by the so called fish monger who was obviously not a trained fish monger, but got his job because of his Progressive music of the soviet era bachelors degree . It took him the better part of 20 minutes to fillet a f-ing fish! All I got was a chopped up piece of crap that was useless. And scoffing is what these people are good at. Pushing your cart down the aisles is like running a scoffing gauntlet. Staff huff and puff when you get in their way?! The cashiers just stand and talk to each other or run to get organic iced tea to drink WHILE they ring you up...they don't even do that at Giant Eagle!The other customers: This one is a peach! If you're not pulling in a good $60K a year you are dirt to these people. I was at the salad bar (it is a good salad bar, but expensive) an older woman in a mink coat bumped, no, pushed into me then stared at me and turned her nose up at me, can you believe it? She actually turned her nose up at me! Others in the aisles will grunt like cantankerous old people if they can't get through. They push ahead in line, give you dirty looks, and act like it's a class struggle...it kind of is!So unless you have a lot (i mean A LOT) of disposable income, have never needed to use coupons, drive a $50K car (parking is terrible there), are the president of the United States, CEO of Microsoft, a widow whose wardrobe is more extensive than the explanation of the formula explaining an event horizon or a hipster who looks poor, but lives off daddy and mommy (though they'll never admit it) you shouldn't and really won't be able to afford this place...but why would you want to?I'll stick with Trader Joe's for my alternative market, thank you! I prefer employees with edges that are a little rough to ones with pants so tight, I can see their junk."
"I always thought 1-star reviews on Yelp were written by bitter, resentful people who had nothing better to do than just complain. But now I feel their pain. It really doesn't hit you, until it... hits you.You pay a premium at WF, you expect a premium, right? Well parking is part of the shopping experience. It's why they have parking lots in the first place. But never mind the atrocious parking lot and not being able to easily maneuver in it.I'm talking about being TOWED. Towed, not for leaving the parking lot, but for legitimately shopping at WF. Yes, this could happen to you too.Upon contacting the towing company, they demanded $135 (cash only) to return my vehicle. Upon contacting WF (since I was a legitimate shopper there and didn't leave the lot) they just shrugged their shoulders and just told me the name of the company that managed the lot.And that's it?! $135 is no chump change, but it seems like WF wants me to carry an extra $135 every time I frequent them (thankfully, never, since I don't live in Pittsburgh). This whole parking/towing situation is extremely shady, but the only company I'm going to point my finger at is Whole Foods for doing business with such a shady complex and passing the burden on to its customers.Tip: Bring an extra $135 to pay for parking, or just go to Trader Joe's/Giant Eagle for a better parking/shopping experience."
I found a bone in a package of in-store made turkey burgers (the tequila lime ones if it matters). Not cool.
"what a horrible thanksgiving dinner, dry turkey, lumpy pototoes, freaky string beans, this is a real live and learn never again, wrote to the store for a comment, but no response, this was to expensive to waste, but that's exactly what it was"
"If I could give them zero stars, I would. Awful! My car wouldn't start so I called the tow and he managed to get it started, but it's been acting up so I brought it in anyways. After having my car for an entire week and not calling me once, after I've called twice, the man on the phone told me it was ready to pick up, nothing wrong with it. When I went to pick it up, I turned it on and before I could even leave the lot, it died! I went back in and told him that the tow truck operator hooked it up to a jumper box and pumped the gas to start it. That's what he did. Then told me it probably didn't start because it was sitting so long. Then he told me ""I don't know anything about your car""! I left and sure enough had trouble getting it started at my next destination, had to pump the gas pedal. Yeah, that sounds like ""nothing's wrong"". DO NOT BRING YOUR CAR HERE. THEY ADMITTEDLY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT CARS!"
"BEWARE - I rented from Franklin West when I was getting my Master's at Carnegie Mellon. They use CMU students as ATM machines and will do everything humanly possible to stick it to you when you move out especially if you are leaving Pittsburgh. My list of complaints:1) they charged me three months rent after I moved out, while the apartment was vacant. This was not in the lease. They conveniently forgot to mention this until I gave them my advance notice i was going to vacate the apartment. 2) they did not return my $1500 security deposit. 3) three years after I move out, they send some delinquent account to a credit agency (they still owe me my security deposit), messing up my credit rating. They never reached out to me, not once!"
"I would caution against this rental company. The properties are beautiful to look at and they roll out the red carpet when you are considering their apartments but once you are in and a tenant, all the niceness stops. They are indifferent and treat every service request conversation as if it is a legal document saying the right things in the vaguest possible manner but not following through.I was completely misled by them when I was in the market for an apartment but I know better now."
Basically a group of lawyers who understand how to use archaic Pittsburgh laws to screw over students. Ridiculous policies and move out fees. Their auto renewing leases are  set in as traps
"I really feel bad about giving a one-star review.  First, it's not about the service, price, decor, or the food.  I'm writing this review after going there twice.  The first time my husband and I went, the dinner was good.  We thought this place has the potential to be our go-to Chinese restaurant in Pgh.  Today I remembered that they have an early-bird special 3-6pm (m-sat).  The won ton soup was not authentic (more like chicken noodle soup) but wasn't bad.  The entree was fine.  What really knocked the score down to 1 is the awful tobacco/cigarette smell from the tea!! ? !!   I had to go to the grocery store and buy a pack of gum.  The smell wouldn't leave me so I came home to rinse my mouth with Listerine (2-3 minutes) then brush (as long as I could) to get rid of the smell.  Did they use the tea pot as an ash tray?  [first visit: 3 stars] + [second visit: -5 stars] = [ -2 stars]"
Closed.  Signage down.  Boarded up tight.  Phone disconnected.
"This is a cut and paste from a review I wrote on apartmentratings.  I read the poor reviews for Kamin, but decided to reserve my judgement of their places until I saw for myself. I must say that after my experience today, I'm thinking that the reviews here are far from hyperbolic. I was scheduled to see two units today - one on Walnut and one on S. Negley. When my boyfriend and I arrived at the first place, the building manager, Paul informed us that we could just look at the unit on Walnut Street because, ""They are identical apartments...Same builder and everything, but if you want to fight against traffic this time of day, we can."" First of all Paul, the floor plan may be the same, but no two units are alike. The kitchen may have been updated in one or maybe the bathroom tile was different, the building may smell different and maybe a potential tenant wants to see the view out the window. Secondly, if we're going to potentially sign a lease to pay almost $1,400 per month, we'd at least like to see the actual unit we'd be living in. In addition to that, the other apartment was only three blocks from this building. We felt that the 8 minute walk would not be that terrible of an inconvenience (for us anyway, but then again Paul seemed to be in a hurry.) Anyway, we got to the first place and Paul let us in. Rather than engage us or talk to us about the apartment, he just stood there in the living room with his arms crossed and left us to wander through the apartment on our own. He didn't offer any information and answered our questions with one or two word answers. Seriously, if he's that rude now, what's he going to be like when the lease gets signed? Strike one. After we left the building on Walnut, the boyfriend and I walked down to S. Negley and met Paul there. He let us in and led us upstairs where he actually let a door slam right in my face. What a nice guy! And so gentlemanly! Strike Two. When we got to the second apartment, we were wandering around when I noticed a gigantic water mark with bubbling paint and all in the corner of the ceiling in one of the bedrooms with a lovely black stain that I can only assume is mold. The current tenant informed me that the roof leaked. Noooooow I know why Paul didn't want us looking at the second unit! Strike three. Kamin's out. We just turned around and walked out at that point. I do have to say though that Paul did us a favor by being so incredibly rude, unprofessional and overall kind of a tool. Heck maybe he hates working for Kamin and this is his way of ""sticking it to the man."" If it weren't for him, we may have believed whatever BS story a *good* salesman would have given us about how they're fixing the roof or whatnot and we may have actually bought the story and been miserable for a year. How lucky for us that Kamin has such a ""pleasant"" guy dealing with the public. It's sad though because overall the apartments would be very desirable if it weren't for Paul and the obviously leaking roof. On to greener pastures!Read more: http://www.apartmentratings.com/rate/PA-Pittsburgh-Kamin-Realty-Corporation-1643760.html#ixzz2RU5PJE81"
"Kamin Realty showed a profound lack of professionalism. Would take several days to respond to e-mails, if they chose to respond at all. I had to make several phone calls to ever get a response from a Kamin representative who was not helpful or gracious to work with.Put a deposit down on a place, however 3 days later, due to unforeseen circumstances I had to cancel. Instead of working with me on refunding or possibly working out a re-advertising cost Kamin denied any services and left me out $700 dollars. In the end, I am glad things didn't work out since they seemed like they would be horrible landlords."
"I haven't even moved into my apartment yet and I'm already regretting renting a property with Kamin. Paul showed us the apartment and he was very nice. I would give him a 5 start rating. It's the woman who answers the phones and emails that I find extremely rude and off-putting. So far, she has hung up on me on the phone, raised her voice to me multiple times, and told me to ""get myself a calendar"" when I asked to get back into my apartment during the week of Memorial Day. I then sent an email with questions for Paul because I didn't want to deal with her anymore. Paul never saw my email and instead she answered my long email of questions with a one word sentence. If I could back out of my lease at this point, I totally 100% would, solely because of the receptionist. But unfortunately I am trapped. Their apartments are decent, but the receptionist needs to attend a few sessions of customer service training and general etiquette courses."
"For our last lunch in Pittsburgh we decided to return to the Big Burrito Group; Eleven was quite good and both Gayot and Pittsburgh Magazine compared the experience at Casbah favorably to that of Big Burrito's crown jewel.  Citing a mix of Mediterranean and Northern African influences with a bargain Piccola Gusto Menu for lunch and the option for indoor or al fresco dining it seemed as if Casbah was a can't miss option...well, sometimes things don't turn out quite as you expect - almost everything that transpired from the moment we arrived until the moment we left was a failure.When our server, a young woman named Amanda L who would prove quite inept and inefficient from start to finish, finally did arrive our menus were delivered with a brief hello before she wandered away - another server later stopped by to fill our water and drinks were never even offered.  When Amanda finally did return she was capable of answering a couple questions about portion size and our orders were placed.  With my mom and sister opting for the two-course Gusto lunch and myself choosing two courses a la carte we sat and sipped our water.Waiting approximately 10 minutes another ancillary server arrived with bread and butter - a light and airy white bread with a hefty crust paired with a sweet and salted cow's milk butter - decent, but nothing to write home about compared to the myriad bread options at Eleven.  After this point we would not see another staff member for 30 minutes...well, we would see them, they just wouldn't be walking anywhere near our table - instead bussing tables and running around while the hostess flirted with a man at the bar...I'll note that my water glass remained empty for greater than 15 minutes.Finished with our first courses approximately 10 minutes would pass - long enough for me to actively collect each and every plate and stack them at the empty seat of our four-top - before Amanda would finally return to collect the dirty plates...we'd not see her again until 15 minutes later when she filled our water glasses and told us our main courses would be ""right out.""  While I guess she didn't define ""right out,"" what this actually meant was ""in 25 minutes.""  Starting first with my mother's combo - Jumbo Lump Crab, pepper bacon, avocado, radish sprouts, on a paesano bun and Orecchiette Pasta with grilled chicken, dried cranberries, Riverview Farms goat cheese, sage cream. While the sandwich may not be memorable, the pasta was actually quite impressive.  Using a less salty cheese and mild cream to flavor the al dente little ears of pasta worked wonders while the sweet/savory mÌ©lange of craisins and grilled chicken were a nice match.Vastly less well done than my mother's plate would be my sister's option - the Grilled Vegetables, portobello, zucchini, eggplant, arugula, chickpea hummus, on baguette and Maccheretto pasta with wild mushrooms, white beans, sun-dried tomatoes, rapini pesto, fontina, walnuts.  Beginning with the sandwich, the bite I had was good in taste but rather mushy in consistency - too many similar vegetable textures and the hummus spread too thickly.  Moving on to the pasta - we all tasted it, but I'm still not sure what we were supposed to be tasting - it tasted like watery cheese...no spice, no salt, and certainly nothing resembling pesto or tomatoes.  For the first time in the meal Amanda actually opted to check on us approximately 10 minutes into our main courses and when told of the watery pasta she did apologize and offered to replace it with something else - more Orcchiette.For my main course I received a simple side salad-fresh greens, crispy onion strings, and a pleasant vinaigrette.  The salad, of course, was served alongside Elysian Fields Lamb ""Mac and Cheese"", tubetti pasta, mascarpone, cheddar, Pecorino-Romano, and bread crumbs.  Piping hot and browned with crispy bread crumbs the dish was a decent Macaroni and Cheese, but honestly the lamb was so scarce and thinly cut that it added little.Completing our mains approximately 110 minutes after entering Casbah we again waited nearly ten minutes before anyone would stop by to collect dirty plates-a different ancillary server this time.  With my mother and sister already deciding enough was enough they stood up to use the restroom before leaving-by the time Amanda would stop by to ask if anyone would care for dessert our two course meal had lasted 2:05 and I skipped on a menu entailing bread pudding, carrot cake, and panna cotta with ""just the bill.""Settling the bill via credit card no tip was left because no tip was deserved - in reality Amanda may have actually be the worst server I've encountered at a fine dining establishment in the last 2 years.  I will note that when I wrote to Big Burrito was met by a (seemingly) sincere apology without excuses - the Manager stated things don't' normally happen like that and he'd be sure the issue was addressed.  He closed with ""I hope you will join us again."" I will not."
"Overpriced, salty and overrated!!! Why this place is so popular I will never understand."
"Three strikes and you're out!  We had brunch there a few months back, and the meal was so salty that we could barely begin to eat it.  That meal was comped and I figured it was an off day.  We went back about a month later for dinner, and that meal was also very salty and we could not finish it.  We were willing to try again, so we went for dinner tonight.  I ordered the filet, and it was like eating a salt shaker.  I was shocked that, for a third time, I had a piss poor meal at Casbah.  I sent that back, and ordered the sea bass.  When I got to the end of the piece of fish, it was raw.  Needless to say, I will NEVER return to this restaurant.  Looking back, what should I have expected from the sister restaurant of Mad Mex?"
"I have heard much about Casbah being one of the best eateries in the 412. I went on their pasta special and got the ricotta ravioli and the short rib ravioli. The ricotta was the second most expensive dish on that menu and we received two saggy, bland pouches of what tasted like a microwaved lunchable. The short rib was doused in a gravy-like sauce that overwhelmed any taste or subtleties that may have existed. Heavy and bland. Not generally what I go out to eat for. The service was also extremely slow. 20 minutes to get our bread and 50 to get our appetizers."
Pasta fest should be called deception fest. We got an email inviting us to come to pasta fest thinking it would be regular portions at a discounted price. WRONG it was smaller portions at a higher price. I never felt so ripped off. $15 for one meatball and three bites of pasta. The server warned us about the small portion but wow . You got me this time but never again.
"This place's reputation as a high-end restaurant is entirely undeserved. Every single entrÌ©e my party ordered was oversalted and bland. And for the price I was expecting much, much more. If you're looking for quality food for $25-35 per plate, go to Meat & Potatoes."
"I stayed at two different apartments in their 5909 building. They were good with maintenance stuff but tried to screw you over wherever they can to get the extra money from you. The lady, Sherry (who is the owner's daughter and run the management company) is very disrespectful-- especially after you've signed the lease.I signed a lease stating that the apartment will be available for move in on August 1st and she yelled at me for asking her for the key on August 1st-- saying that I should take into account that it needs to be cleaned-- that's NOT how leases work. When the lease states a move-in date, it literally means that. I didn't have the apartment until August 6th but until then they only had the carpet changed. The apartment was not cleaned. I had to request them to give me a cleaning coupon and prorate the rent for August for me-- they did both but nothing makes up for the urgency I was in since my sick brother needed the apartment urgently and I had conveyed that to her before signing the lease-- that and the fact that she was arrogant because she knew we were pretty limited in our options. Also, they tried to squeeze in every penny from our security deposit. My ex-roommate had magnets on the fridge that left a couple of pink stains on it. They charged us $531 for that-- the fridge worked fine.If you didn't have to deal with Sherry the place won't be a bad idea to stay but her attitude problem and unprofessionalism makes it really hard. Melita is a much more professional person to speak to but she only works for Sherry.The apartments are not bad but it's very poorly managed."
"Maybe I am just the most jaded vegan in town; Quiet Storm's food menu bores me to tears, that which I will use to salt my own mediocre cooking at home! Their coffee isn't all that great either, as given the choice, local La Prima is in my favor. Tears. This is the only vegetarian restaurant on the East side of town, and oh so close to me, but I cannot stand to go there. Desperate times now call for toast and tea served by the sad server that resides within my depressed little dining room."
"I must be a glutton for punishment, because I keep finding myself hungrily returning to the Quiet Storm. The menu has slightly changed, and they are no longer cash only... This time it was the ""8th Ward"" that inflicted extreme disappointment. Not sure what 8th Ward is supposed to mean, but I will forever associate it with a dry boring place. And I thought we were getting a party platter! This appetizer sampler included THE WORST hummus evaar; I am near positive that they forgot to add garlic, lemon, salt and tahini to this chickpea paste that which was described as ""garlicky"" on the menu. Sooo wrong. ""The Butter,"" another WTF of a name, was also very dry and bland. The salsa was good! And there were plenty of dipping accessories, too many really, given the smallness of the unappetizing dip portions.At this point, I've tried most of the vegan options QS has to offer and the only luck I've had has been with the B.Y.O.B. Go figure. I wouldn't care so much about how much of a tease this place is if I didn't REALLY desire a comfortable neighborhood place to eat comfortable food with a comfortable view of a cute waitress who writes fiction. And it frustrates me that few others seem to recognize the culinary (I shutter at even calling it that) mediocrity of ""the best"" vegetarian restaurant Pittsburgh has to offer."
"I'm a vegetarian and have lived behind the restaurant for over 3 years. Every time I have ever gone, the service is awful. It's as if they're doing you a favor by waiting on you. I think their breakfasts are pretty good and their lentil loaf is good but usually your sides consist of yellow nacho chips with brown jalopeno slaw. Also, the cooks look like they are lacking hygeine. the one great thing about this place is their coffee, and that's it."
"Yes, it is reasonably priced.  Yes, my food was tasty (6 on a scale of 1-10).  However, the place did not look clean to me--I won't be back because of that."
"Ugh... I got a plate with seisage, tofu scramble, and sundried tomato toast. My whole plate was entirely dry, chewy, and unpalatable. I had high hopes for the tofu scramble, especially after seeing positive reviews about it. But honestly... It tasted like nothing. I thought it'd be moister with a creamy consistency that might come from silken tofu, but it was hard, dry, and chewy. Hubby got a country burrito that was much better in comparison to my plate... But that might have been due to the fact that his whole plate was doused in gravy. Anything will taste better drenched in gravy. We think the gravy tastes like the powdered packet kind where you just add water. On top of all this service wasn't the greatest. I had to fish around for my own ketchup and they didn't even bother to ask me what kind of toast (3 options on the menu)I wanted when I ordered the toast option for my meal. Then they didn't bother to ask hubby if he wanted anything to drink after he had picked one of the $12 entrees that come with coffee or juice. We had to tell someone else to get it for us. Also they don't really wash their cups. There are 2 sink basins at the front where they just dunk the cups in one soapy basin then dunk the cups in a second water basin and then stack them next to the sink. It made me not want to drink my water even though I was thirsty. Good idea, but poorly executed food. I've had good vegan and vegetarian food before that's consisted of a lot of fresh greens, avocados, and more. For a vegetarian place, there was nothing green on our plates. This experience sadly fell enormously short of our expectations... Could've eaten at kaya or meat and potatoes for the same price."
"Worst tofu scramble ever. Days old, cold, hard, inedible.  Sent it back and had no time to wait for another dish. I can't even believe that the server, let alone the  ""chef"" thought it appropriate to serve. Brought my 2 year old along, had to get a high chair, I'm able to do this just would have been nice if asked by server if we needed one."
"I imagine that this is the restaurant that I would make if I were 20 years old and knew nothing about restaurants except dining in them and what looks and sounds cool.  In that it does some things right, but none of the important things.  It has a decent sized shop with large windows and its bright, so that's good.  They have good music, but unfortunately we were seated right below one of what looked like two speakers in the place.  Its a large restaurant so in order to make it the right volume for people far away from the speaker it has to be too loud for the people close to the speaker.  I know the trade-offs of sound systems all too well.  If only there was a way to solve this problem like... just riffing here... more speakers at a lower volume?They had a greatest hits of the thrift store type of decor and the standard shitty artists selling their paintings like at every coffee house you've ever been to.  They include coffee/tea/juice/whatever in the price of the brunch because, like everyone, I hate choices too and I definitely wanted at least one of those.  I'm looking at the menu and its a vegan/veggie place so we're never going to be good friends but I'd like to think that there's something that looks halfway decent but it all looks awful.  There are two Tex-Mex-Ranchero breakfast dishes... that's at least one too many; and there's only like eight choices which sounds like plenty as a number but I assure you it was not enough here.I go with the Egg Frittata as my least bad option and it ends up tasting mostly flavorless but with a distinct stale note.  It comes with a salad that is not bad, but who wants a salad for breakfast.  As we're leaving the waiter, who's been fine the whole time, asks us where we're from and my girlfriend answers ""D.C.""  The waiter replies, ""Oh, I'm sorry about that.""  Now, neither of us is actually born in the D.C. area, nor do I even particularly like living there.  So I'm not personally offended, but I'm not sure if someone from or living in Pittsburgh has solid footing to talk the business about Washington D.C. or almost any other large city.  Its not like property values in Pittsburgh are indicating that everyone's clammoring to live there, whereas in Washington D.C., they are.I was not enjoying the restaurant before that, but this kid actually threw me to straight up hating it.  If you're vegan and have literally no other options... then I guess you're going here.  If both of those conditions aren't true, then go anywhere else."
"It's cheap, I'll say that, but otherwise it's bland food served by workers who mostly don't seem to notice they're working, and when they do, only respond snarkily. There are many better vegetarian and vegan options to choose from."
"I was pretty disappointed with this place. I thought from the good reviews that the pizza would taste okay. I went here around 12am on a Friday so maybe their ingredients weren't as fresh. I ordered a medium veggie pizza with a side of fries. The fries were super soggy and the pizza was pretty flavorless. There are only about 2 seats inside so you pretty much have to take it to go which was fine with me. The people working there are really nice though which is a plus. Overall, i wouldn't go back."
"They have inaccurate hours posted. I tried to order at 11:30 pm when yelp says they close at 2am and they were already closed. When I told them they have inaccurate hours posted the guy on the phone said ""oh that's ok...."" And hung up on me. I will never be ordering from them again, which is a shame since they are so close to me. I immediately called Pizza Parma which gladly delivered to me. I recommend ordering from Pizza Parma since they have similar menu items, they post accurate hours, and they don't hang up on you! Seriously? Why answer the phone?"
"It seems like every other time I take my pets to Point Breeze there is an unnecessary frustration.   From being berating for using their online prescription program to being misquoted prices substantially to poor customer service I just keep hoping each time will be better.  Although I know they love animals I suspect they love money more.  Dr. Caroline. Simard is an excellent vet, but my last two visits have been pushed to other vets whose bedside manner is atrocious.   I'm a 40 year-old  who has been taking my pets to vets since childhood and I don't understand why each visit leaves a sour taste in my mouth."
"Refused to take my cat, which had passed away, for cremation cause I had not been to the clinic previously. IMHO that's ridiculous. I will not recommended anyone to ever come here."
"Used to love the Co-op despite its flaws.  Continuous turnover, especially at higher levels, poor communication to customers, blatantly hostile/condescending attitude from some staff.   All been going on for years. There was some improvement for awhile, but it has gotten worse.  A few individual employees are pleasant and competent, but the organization overall has some serious issues with ethics/transparency.   They're actually worse than some large corporate stores in these areas.  Pittsburgh has many choices for healthy food - farmers markets and CSAs - and that's where we purchase much of our food now.  Suggest you do the same."
"The blonde woman who tuns the gym was extremely rude to us. First time we went she refused yo.get off the phone on a personal call to help us. Then she gave us the rules for the bouldering area in a rapid bored monotone. Compared to other climbing gyms I have gone to this gym is less safe (no gri-gris), unfriendly, and more expensive. Definitely not worth it. Worst customer service I've seen in a while."
"Pros:- At least there's a climbing gym in this area- Walls get reset oftenCons:- I've been coming here a couple times a week for the past few months now, and I have felt like some of the walls really need some padding besides the not-so-great spring board they have. The walls are pretty high and the height + lack of mats retract me from climbing certain routes, which is really disappointing because it ruins my climbing experience. - I brought up the aforementioned lack of mats to the woman who works here, and she snapped at me: ""Mats are only supposed to be under walls that are sloped."" I told her the wall I was talking about was sloped, and she replied curtly ""If you don't feel comfortable climbing those walls without a mat, then you shouldn't even be climbing them."" I was in shock. Is this a way you should be addressing your climbers' legitimate concerns? Even if it isn't possible to have mats, she could have at least told me in a nicer way instead of talking to me as if I knew nothing. - The gym closes at 11PM on Fridays. I usually go at night until they close, but the staff passive aggressively starts turning off the gym lights around 10:50PM. I get it, it's a Friday night and you want to get outta here. But the business hours are until 11PM, so let me enjoy my last ten minutes of climbing because I am paying for my climbing membership and I want to get as much climbing as I can get out of my sessions at the gym. - The holds are old and covered in rubber from the shoes. It would be nice if they could at least pressure wash them every once in a while. - The fees are unreasonable for the customer experience we get here."
Worst climbing gym I have ever been to. Customer service was a joke. Wall appears as if a boy scout went ham with a few sheets of plywood back in the 80s and then did nothing since then. Holds are prehistoric and grimy. Setting is subpar. Insurance doesn't allow for people who can't belay to be belayed? Better off climbing the outside of the building for a good pump..
The ventilation in the bouldering area is terrible. Please install some chalk eaters. People are inhaling tons of chalk into their lungs and are going to get pneumoconiosis from climbing at your gym.
"I was home for the holidays and wanted to take some friends of mine climbing.  They've never belayed and don't have equipment so my hope was that we could go, I could test out of the belay class and we could top rope some easy climbs.Dreams crushed.  Only people that are belay certified can even be in the top rope room.  I would've had to pay $5 to test out of the certification and even if my friends wanted to take a quick lesson on how to belay, its only at very specific times and you need to give advanced notice.So we bouldered.  The walls are old, made of smooth plywood and though the walls are a good variety, you eventually end up right on top of one another.  You can only top out on one tiny section, everything else backs right up to another wall or and abyss.  With someone who isn't super comfortable down climbing or jumping from the top, I wasn't always super excited to fall when there wasn't a nice big cushion.  Those were only on the overhanging walls.The place was super busy on a Sunday afternoon and group after group rolled in.  I understood why there were so many VB and VB+ routes (easier than V0's).Side note: cubbies are completely separate from the bouldering area and no food or drinks are allowed inside the bouldering area.  Therefore your water stays in your cubby, plan carefully.I expected better from Pittsburgh and heard that there is a new gym coming, so I'll be waiting for that one before I try to climb again in da burgh."
Don't go. I got more problems and sounds on my car after I spent $800 there. unbelievable!
"I've eaten here once after having it suggested by numerous people, I was totally disappointed with the service, food, and the place itself, I will not be headed back......everSave your money, or starve either would be a better option"
"This was the first time for me and my wife at the celebrated Cafe Zinho. Parking in the residential area in which the restaurant is located is next to impossible on a busy Saturday night; the diner should be prepared to walk a distance to get to the restaurant from where he or she is ultimately able to park.  The greatest drawback is that the restaurant is tiny and the seating so tight that at our table, it was necessary to sit uncomfortably in order to avoid being bumped by anyone that walked by, which happened repeatedly as we were in a busy thoroughfare of food delivery.  No other table offered a much better situation and all others were occupied at the busy time we arrived, 6:45 p. m. The online menu boasts of a daily vegetarian and vegan special entree, but there was no such entree on this night.  There was only one non-meat item on the small menu, ravioli.  Our gracious server, Ramon, said that the kitchen could prepare a couscous and vegetable dish if the vegetarian in our party wanted it, and that was what we did.  The restaurant permits customers to bring their own alcoholic beverages, a nice convenience and savings for the diner.  A small portion of bread was served with a tiny amount of rock-hard butter.  My mushroom and cheese soup was a large portion, served piping hot, which was great, but it was a puree with no distinct mushroom pieces.  I would not have been able to distinguish it as mushroom soup.  All of our entrees were attractively presented and were tasty, average size portions.  All were served with a small amount of good, fresh vegetables. It would be helpful if the menu offered some description of the following entree so that the diner with an interest in a chicken dish would not have to inquire about it of the server:  ""chicken maputoRoasted w/ piri piri & chocolate scented sauce"".  Does the average diner know what ""maputo"" and ""piri piri"" are? The lemon tart dessert was a small piece not suitable for sharing, served with two minute pieces of strawberries and a small dollop of whipped cream.  It was not flavorful or moist nor worth the calories.  The gracious owner, Tony Pais, stopped at our table for a moment to greet us, a nice touch, and there were quality checks by a manager and Ramon.  I noticed a number of prominent people from the community dining here, individuals whom I was surprised were willing to spend a good deal of money to be packed into a sardine can of a restaurant.  Apparently they consider this to be the only restaurant in town.  The rest rooms are small, one-person facilities, naturally. An unfortunate surprise occurred when the individual that was picking up the check for my party presented his credit card only to be told that the restaurant accepts only cash and checks, this for a tariff of $148 plus gratuity.  It is supposed to be of some consolation that there is an Automatic Teller Machine on site.  I imagine less than 1% of expensive restaurants today are cash only.  Cafe Zinho is a highly flawed restaurant, demonstrating that there is more to a fine dining experience than simply offering fine cuisine.  If one is able to get beyond the feeling one has when visiting the rest room on a commercial airliner, the diner might enjoy it: not us.I posted comments about the restaurant at its Facebook page, in which I noted my displeasure with being cramped and uncomfortable, and about the restaurant being unique in its unwillingness to accept credit cards for a $148 check.  An individual identifying himself as the manager, who apparently had never received constructive criticism from anyone, initially demonstrated rage, posting a message that I can go to the Oiive Garden the next time I dine out.  He later added with similar condescension that I can use a coupon and a credit card at The Olive Garden.  Later, he thought better of his outburst and removed the comments...along with mine.  He ultimately offered me and my wife the opportunity to return to the restaurant at his expense.  I thanked him for the offer, but told him that one experience at Cafe Zinho was enough.  I had no intention of returning even if he had responded to my comments like a gentleman."
"These people could not care less. I am still waiting for my washer dryer to get fixed -its been almost a month now and I am being told that they don't even know when the technician will return. The technician has been here 4 times already. Each time there is supposedly something else wrong and so they have to order another part. Miraculously the part is wrong (first week), They forgot to order the second part (2nd week), Part comes in but they need a suppossed other part and it will be ""another 3-5 days""(3rd week), Fourth week rolls by and they ""don't know"" when its coming in (thats up to the distributor). When I ask for an ETA (because I am wearing dirty clothes, and I am sick of technicians coming back 5 times and I already took off a week of work to meet these people) the cus.t service rep gets mad at me and offers me a refund. (The washer is on warranty) They obviously don't want to deal with any problems they created. So now I have to call the distributor to see when the part is coming in (yup,  thats YOUR job Appliance Service Center!)."
"Repairman arrived at my home without the necessary parts to do the repair.  Not a huge deal except I work an hour away from my home so it's a problem when I take time off and don't get the intended result.  When I called for the estimate the next week they informed me that the part had already been ordered...when in fact it hadn't.  They called back to say that they did not order the part and it would be X dollars.  Not only did they charge MORE than they quoted they installed a BLACK handle on a stainless refrigerator.  Very rude when I called them out on it and then lied about it.  They said they spoke to my husband about the increase in price and installing the WRONG COLOR because the Stainless wasn't available. Who, in their right mind, would pay $312 for the WRONG color handle?  Do not trust them."
"And so....the search for a new hair salon continues. Sigh. Don't get me wrong, the cut was a good cut. The salon itself was clean and stylish. The owner, welcoming and friendly. Now what went wrong. The cut was good, but it certainly wasn't what I expected from a salon with the reputation of Izzazu. I wasn't bowled over by my stylist's professionalism either. Don't diss my previous stylist....she rocked....you don't do yourself any favors by knocking someone else.  (And come on, I was WAAAYYYY overdue for a cut since I've been driving to Cleveland for a style.)  That being said, for $55 (and saving big bucks on gas, tolls, lunch and shopping) the cut was still a deal. But, when I started to sign the charge slip, it said $65, not $55. ""But,"" I said, ""the website said it was $55 for a Master stylist."" ""Oh,"" the chick at the counter said, ""that's for Men's cuts."" Silly me. So when I got back to the office, I went online and checked. Nope, it said $55 for a Master Stylist WOMEN's haircut. Hmmmmm. So I called. The chick at the counter now said, ""Oh, our stylist's charge whatever they feel the cut SHOULD be."" What?????? So I quoted the prices to her from the Izzazu website. She changed her tune again. ""Oh, well.....I'll refund you $10 if you give me your credit card number."" Didn't she have my slip with the card number? ""Sorry, I don't give my credit card number over the phone."" ""Or I can send you a gift certificate."" ""Nope,"" I said through clenched teeth, ""I won't be coming back.""It wasn't the cut. It was the bait and switch. I'd gladly have paid it had they been up front and above-board ahead of time. As Judge Judy says, ""Don't pee on my leg and tell me it's raining."" The search goes on. Or I'll be back in Cleveland in the spring for the next cut!P. S.  One amusing side note:  I checked in at Izzazu when I arrived.  Turns out, I'm the Duchess!  The Duchess is displeased."
"Sadly, the professionalism of the front desk never got better.  Despite Emilio's assurances that changes were being made, my latest visit proved otherwise.  I called ahead and was assured that Marshall was on time...in fact, he didn't have an appointment ahead of mine and could take me as soon as I got there.  I was there a few minutes before my appointment.  I waited.  And waited.  Fifteen minutes later, I asked if Marshall knew I was waiting.  I was told by the brunette that they had been busy.  Odd, she, the blonde and two other employees had been standing there talking for a while.  She went back to notify Marshall.  When Marshall came up front to get me, the brunette admonished him that he should keep an eye out for his clients - she shouldn't have to notify him that his appointment is there.  Wow.  And the purpose of a receptionist is....what?  I'm done.  I'm out.  Apparently nothing will help Izzazu's but getting rid of the front desk staff.  On a positive note, it was another great cut.  Not good enough to lure me back, though."
"Awful facial with lulu. Used a groupon and thought it may be why she was so terribly unattentive, but realized she had no idea what I was paying with. Basically I got the 'steam machine' blowing on my face for 40 min!  Would give negative stars if I could."
"I had an appointment that was made 2 months in advance and when I turned up they told me that the person I had the appointment with quit 6 weeks ago and they didn't have anyone available to take me. They made no attempt to reschedule me with someone else or call me to cancel. To make things worse, the battleax at the front desk had such an attitude. Here's a tip, when you are in the beauty salon business, staff the front desk with someone who looks like they have actually BEEN to a salon. Not with rude women that have hairdos from 20 years ago. Will never go back."
"Emailed and called several times to get a pricing on having several services done at once as a graduation present to myself. I was put on hold twice and never picked back up. Emails went unanswered.  :(I was going to have SO MUCH done, too!! Hair cut, color with highlights, spa manicure/pedicure and an hour massage! All as a graduation present to myself but if they can't be attentive to prospective customers then I can't imagine that they'd be attentive in the store. I'll spend my money elsewhere!"
"Unbelievable experience! Literally unbelievable. I waited 50 minutes and finally walked out. Receptionists were beyond awful. I booked 3 style appointments in advance for a wedding. One person was taken right away, 20 minutes later the second person was taken.  I WAITED 50 MINUTES while being ignored by the receptionists.  I can celled because the others were almost done and we would be running late. My stylist finally came out and said he'd quickly do my hair. What !! I'm not paying $100 to get rushed service. We were looking forward to a relaxing, fun experience. More unbelievable, I waited 20 minutes to pay for the two services. One receptionist couldn't take transactions and another was occupied with a wedding party.  I was so close to walking out and not paying. Unfortunately the two stylists didn't get a tip through no fault of their own. I can't give an unbiased opinion of their work as I am still furious in the way I was treated.  I would expect some ambiance at $100 for shampoo & style. I could never recommend Izzazu. Denham & Company is on Market Square, their rates are reasonable and within walking distance of the Fairmont. I am calling the concierge tomorrow informing her of my experience."
"I wanted to find a new place and tried the Wexford location since I live nearby after seeing a coupon for a haircut. OMG, I have an appointment this weekend to get my hair fixed, though it will be hard to do because I went in for a TRIM and I lost about 5 inches of hair and it is still uneven. My part which was on the left is now kinda zig zagged and my hair sticks up and out all over. I asked often about the hair being cut and I was told it was not much length but helping to get rid of the volume (I have thick hair). Yea, well 3 inches cut with my hair wet is now over 5 inches dry because of how curly my hair is, which I mentioned oh, I don't know maybe 100 times b/c she kept asking me about doing a treatment to straighten it.  No wonder they need coupons for customers. And I still tipped her because how bad I felt for her because she was telling me how poor she is because of her divorce. I should have just walked out when I was left waiting for over 30 minutes without anyone saying a word about it."
I arrived for my appointment at 1 o'clock on time and after sitting and waiting for half an hour was told that the stylist was running behind and it would be at least another half an hour until she could get to me. I guess her time or the current customer's time was more important than mine. I didn't stay to find out how the haircut would have gone.
"Okay I had heard and read about this place since moving to this side of town and finally came. Big waste of time and gas. They Do Not have ice cream, only soft serve. Well I ordered butter pecan 'ice cream' and what do they bring me? Vanilla! Wow are their servers just lazy or dumb?"
"This place isn't very good. I ordered a sundae and asked for a flavored ice cream but was told they could only do chocolate or vanilla because of ""how they mix it"".  It's a sundae so no mixing is involved so I don't understand that. Then when I got it, it was missing half the toppings that were listed in the description. Definitely not as good as people claim. Won't be going back."
Horrible - they use chicken that's been out uncover all day . And they smoke around the food.:(
"The menu online gives no prices, and the entrees are ridiculously overpriced for what you get - a good meal, but far too much food, and nothing extraordinary. The entrees are $50 - $60. BE WARNED - if you want atmosphere to go with your $60 entree, you'd better REQUEST DOWNSTAIRS! Otherwise you can have your anniversary dinner in a small room in front of large televisions. Who knew? And the staff will definitely not accommodate your request for a more romantic spot - even if they know it is your tenth anniversary! Wow. Should have walked out."
"No better in taste than a Fazoli or even an Olive Garden.  Inflated prices, like the cheapest entree was $40, try to disguise this place as something it is not.  Went with a group of co workers, so we pretty much got everything on the menu and not one thing stuck out really good.  Service is incredibly slow.  Not worth it at all.  Even if you tell yourself that atleast the portions are large, the food is just not good enough to warrant wasting a meal eating there."
"The first time I went here was with a group - we had reserved the entire restaurant for a retirement party.   I had a horrible experience.  Vowed never to go back!  At that time, I even had a terrible interaction with the owner.This time I was invited with a couple of girlfriends because they love it. Decided to try again since it was more about the ""get together"" than the food/location.This time, overpriced food and bad service.  Overall, it was not anything out of the ordinary and not worth the price.   I had the veal speciality.   Large portion, but ok.  Staff was not very attentive for the small amount of customers present.I am a Pittsburgh native.  This is a bad neighborhood. I am NOT interested in ever going back!"
There was a wonderful staff that I would go for to my surprise the last time I went I was disappointed the wonderful staff he had was gone I was not happy with my last experience and it was not as homey and family oriented as it was before food wasn't that great either! Not happy about the new staff. Also over heard the owner using racial slurs and provocative terms that just made my stomach turn for these reasons I will not be returning!
This is the worst Chinese food I have had in a long time. The Crab Rangoon was clunky and too thick. There was no crab on the inside-it was all cream cheese. The egg roll I had was dripping grease and was filled with cabbage and nothing else. There were no other veggies or anything. The Sesame Chicken was mushy by the time I got home and I live 5 minutes away. It was all mushy breading and very little chicken. I ate 3 bites and threw it away. This meal was an EPIC FAIL.
They are never open on Sundays... even though they are supposed to be.. I am starting to think maybe they folded and are out of business
"Yesterday I had the misfortune of getting a pizza from Bishops. It was my first time getting a pizza from there in a long time. Needless to say. I won't be getting one again. I got a pepperoni and sausage pizza. The pizza was bland , tasteless. Crust tasted like frozen pizza crust. The sauce was meh. Cheese was okay. Sausage was disgusting. Bishops used to use a delicious hot sausage. I don't know what this sausage was other then disgusting. I don't recommend getting a pizza from Bishops"
"The customer service is absolutely horrible. They made me wait an hour before anybody got to me, and there were 3 available beauticians in the back. I complained and got waited on right away. I thought the customer always came first. Why would they want to risk a customer not coming back. I mean I can just go down the road to Borics. These women are old middle aged miserable employees with no passion for their jobs. I won't be back. DISAPPOINTED...:("
"I've only had one experience at Frank & Shirley's, which was enough to be my last. I didn't even get to sit down before I was disgusted by this place. While waiting to be seated, a man came from the kitchen with a toilet plunger in hand, and went to unclog the toilet. Afterwards, without washing his hands or anything, walked back into the kitchen, still carrying the plunger, dripping the entire way. I was absolutely horrified! I will never ever consider going back there."
"I'm in the market for a fun little scooter to have fun and commute on, and at the suggestion of a friend, I went to Bohn Cycle Shop to check out what they had in the shop. Immediately upon walking in, it took 15 minutes for someone to ask if we were helped. When I mentioned that I wanted to learn more about a Zuma over in the corner, the dude at the desk was disinterested and unhelpful.When I tried to pay for the scooter and roll it out, an older woman stewed around and gave me annoyed looks for coming into the store and not calling ahead. When I tried to pay with a bank-issued check, I had to wait around for nearly 20 minutes before they told me that they have never seen a bank-issued check and sent me on my way.The entire time I was there, it felt like they thought I just stole a bunch of money and were treating me like a crook. I am definitely not going back to complete the transaction. If I'm going to be buying an expensive piece of machinery, I really expect the service to at least be a little more enthusiastic.Like Nick T. said, I guess it's a good place if you wanna grab a used bike or know exactly what you want. If you're looking to broker a new bike, go to a bigger shop with salesmen that actually sound like they're living beings."
"DO NOT GO HERE FOR SERVICE ON YOUR BIKE. I dropped my bike off for an oil change after calling ahead of time (11am). They told me there was no one ahead of me for service. I called back at the end of the day only to be told my bike couldn't get looked at until the next day! When I questioned as to why my oil change wasn't done if they didn't have other services ahead of mine, the very rude and incompetent guy who runs their service department told me ""I was busy with other stuff"". From now on I will be taking my business elsewhere because this place is a joke."
"Maybe I just had a bad day.  This was THE WORST ""pizza"" I've ever had.  I have had Original DiCarlo's in Wheeling, WV in several locations.  This is not even worthy of the name.  I got 3 extra cheese.  First off, the pizza was basically glued to the wax paper.  The crust was unevenly cooked.  First bite the crust was almost raw, dense, and way too chewy.  The sauce tasted sour and the cheese (shredded, not dices provolone like the Original) was slimy.  My second bite, the crust was burned, tasted burned, but at least it was crunchy.  There was no third bite.  The remaining slices got tossed in the garbage.  This was by far the worst ""pizza"" I've ever had."
"1Do not do business with this company The owner is a thief. He will send pink notices that look like bills and instead they are service packs he attempts to get you to enroll. The service is awful, follow up on issues is non existent,the company will give you a 7 day notice and suspend your POS license for even questioning an invoice and shut down your entire business. The techs are part time and walk out of your business if they can't address an issue and push it to another part time tech... Save yourself the aggravation... I have FUTURE POS AND BOUGHT THE LICENSES SO IM STUCK!! and go direct to the dealer in Butler PA.. This company's the worst and can't even keep employees... They do have 2 techs that have been with the company one more incompetent the the other...you have been warned!!!"
If zero was an option that is what i would rate them! They are the worst company to ever deal with all they want is money! I called tec support to get my back office un-locked and they said it would be $600 i already bought the system for $4000
Zero if that was an opinion. Worst POS company in Pittsburgh deal with Cutting Edge Solutions in Butler or any other POS company other than NCR/Aloha.
"I am kind to all service workers! always! This place has the worst service I have ever seen. I do not expect four star treatment from fast food but this place is ridiculous. You better check your bag because they are going to forget something. Yesterday my husband went to get a quickie family fish dinner. He was told that no sorry we are out of hushpuppies and Pepsi. Okay thats fine but what can we have to replace the hushpuppies? He was told to go down the street there is a store. This is inside, not the drive thru. It seems that this is a common experience at this restaurant. I already sparingly frequent fast food establishments but this will definitely be the last attempt. And yes I have contacted the corp. I dont want anything from them though, they can keep it."
Not very good very disappointed
Very disappointed. Wouldn't recommend at all. Got a large pizza. The quality was horrible. The sauce was not a good flavor at all. I had to wait 2 hours just for a pick up for this crap. Their pizza box was more like a diaper. The Pizza bagels were soggy yet burned. The employees looked like a bunch of drug addicts hanging out. And the Prices too high. Biggest waste of money!!
"I came and left after seeing all the changes, I was here to check out the place after the hospital mentioned it was a cool bar.  I think all the hype from my colleagues was not justified.........Not a great menu, just a boring bar!!  It's a shame, what happened???? I was looking forward to a great place to hang out, eat and chug beers."
"This place is a dump. Being new to Pittsburgh we bought a bunch of Groupons to try new places in town. We decided to check out the Park House for a bite to eat and a few drinks. What a joke. Even though the Groupon included menu items, they don't have a kitchen. They have a microwave on the bar and all of their food choices are microwave. Gross, and it's a dirty, sketchy bar on the corner of East Ohio and Cedar. Never again ... They can keep the other Groupon. Maybe they can use the money to buy some real food."
"This place is pretty terrible, but it is the only place to get gas in the area. It's always overcrowded and the receipts never print."
"I developed my 120 film here the other day, and they charged me an extra 4 dollars a roll for no reason.  On the website they say $8 but they charged me $12.  The owner is very pretentious and rude.  When I told him that it says 8 dollars online he didn't care at all.  When I dropped my film off the high school kid didn't even tell me the price because ""it is too much for me to calculate""  Also, the photo equipment, darkroom equipment and film are way over priced.  I am never going back to this place.  I strongly urge everyone to never enter or deal with Bernie's Photo.  Rather, use the websites of companies like B&H, Adorama, or Calumet.  The have MUCH better customer service and better prices.  Very disappointed that this is the only photo store in the city."
"Went in to buy a cold shoe adapter in a pinch on my way to a shoot. He charged me $20 for the same exact item that sells for $6.29 at B&H. I bought it without thinking, as I was stressing on the way to a gig, but was furious when I thought about it in the car.Unfortunately, this is the only game in town. Makes me glad I live in New York City. You would think a store in a dying industry would thrive to provide better customer service, pretty much the only reason why I would go to a small store rather than a big one. They don't even offer that."
"Just stopped in to see about selling my Canon Rebel T3 to buy a 60D (that they don't have in stock because it's ""old""). I was offered $50 for my T3, that is currently being sold online for over $300. I asked why such a low price and was told that since it was an older model it wasn't worth as much. Needless to say, I walked out with my T3. Sucks that this is the ONLY camera shop in Pittsburgh."
"Despite living in PIttsburgh for most of my life, I've somehow managed to never eat at Max's Allegheny Tavern until recently.  My initial impression of the restaurant was positive - the place had an old neighborhood feel to it, a small crowd was drinking at the end of the antique hardwood bar, and the German murals on the walls made me crave an icy-cold German lager with a stout head of foam.  I thought about how well German potato salad would taste with that beer.  So I grabbed a seat at the bar and eagerly awaited the first taste of my beer.And I waited...and waited...and waited some more - for over 15 minutes before someone came around to take the order.  Actually that isn't quite accurate.  Two employees came around - one to the end of the bar, and one behind the bar directly opposite me.  Both of them stared at me.  Neither one greeted me or asked me what I would have like to order.  I stared back, incredulously, and even made a ""what's going on here"" palms-extended-upward-shoulder-shrug gesture.  Neither one took the hint.Finally a third employee came around the bar and took my order.  Great, I thought to myself, finally that beer.  She served the beer in a Mason jar.  WTF?!?  Who serves imported German lager at a German restaurant in a freaking Mason jar?  Max's does.  The beer was devoid of its head, likely the result of a bad beer pour and/or a less than perfectly clean glass (an endemic problem with Pittsburgh restaurants, in my observation).  I was sad.  I quaffed my beer quickly in an attempt to salve my irritation and opened the menu.My first impression of the menu can be summed as follows: ""Uh-oh"".  The menu is huge with a number of ""slow-food"" stews and braises.  The restaurant is more than half-empty.  How can a restaurant prepare such a large number of menu items, including more than a few labor-intensive dishes, freshly every day and still stay in business when the place isn't even half-full?  Answer: They can't.  The food isn't fresh.I ordered the Wiener Schnitzel.  I love properly prepared Wiener Schnitzel.  Made with fresh butterflied veal breast, slightly pounded and seasoned, well-coated in fresh bread crumbs, and pan-fried in clarified butter until golden brown on the outside and juicy on the inside, Wiener Schnitzel is the ultimate comfort food.  Sadly, Max's Wiener Schnitzel had nothing to do with properly prepared Schnitzel.  The veal was super-thin, had a texture that strongly suggested it had been mechanically processed, and tasted as if it was pre-breaded and frozen.  It wasn't pan fried either.  The breaded, frozen, puck was simply dropped into a fryolater - where the breading puffed out and fell off of the meat in places (which doesn't happen when the cutlet is resting against the cooking surface under its own weight as when the dish is properly pan-fried).  The edges of the sad Schnitzel had curled up and it looked a horrible mess on the plate.  Curly Schnitzel?!?  My stomach dropped.My sides, German potato salad and braised red cabbage, were equally awful.  The German potato salad had an unnatural glossy sheen - the kind that typically comes from bottled sauces that contain high fructose corn syrup.  The ""bacon"" in the dressing was nothing more than tiny flecks of some sort of processed, possibly faux, ""meat"".  The potatoes were suspiciously uniform in thickness and roundness - exactly the homogeneity that is found in pre-peeled, pre-sliced, vacuum-sealed processed potatoes.  It was a gluey, sickly sweet, mess.  I didn't have more than a bite or two.  The braised red cabbage didn't taste fresh - it tasted like it had been sitting in a steam table for a day or two and my order was its last chance to be eaten.  Max's Allegheny Tavern bills itself on their web site as, ""The Best in German Fare.  The Best in Service"".That's total bullshit.  It's awful - both for service and fare.If you want good, authentic, German fare (in which the Schnitzel is properly pan-fried to order and delicious), join the Teutonia Mannerchor down the street.  I'll never return."
"I must of been eating at another Max's in a pararell universe!Food was terriable, service was worse! Went and got Sushi!"
"My husband and I have been to this restaurant many times over the past 20 years and went for sandwiches tonight. Sorry to say it was the worst food we have ever eaten at this place. Reuben sandwich was greasy and had little meat. Sweet potato fries were not edible. We ate at a table at the bar and told Andy our bartender but got zero satisfaction. Since we've had such a bad experience and no effort by the restaurant to remedy a BAD MEAL, be warned!"
"I was.very disappointed in the food. If you want bland tasteless food, then stop here. They need to get out of the 70's with the decor.I ordered the corned beef and cabbage sandwich, it was edible but not enjoyable. Don't waste your money here there are much better choices"
"Not a fan of this ""german"" place. Simply awful. We ordered the Potato Pancake Reuben and a Traditional Reuben. So much gristle in the meat. Very low quality food for the price. The bar is cool, have stopped here in the past and enjoyed the atmosphere of the bar. Bar yes.Food/Restaurant no."
Terrible service. I will NOT be visiting this place again. The owner gave me a serious attitude when I asked to pay for my order of 5 sandwiches in 2 different payment methods. There were a few people at my work that asked them to pick up lunch for them as well. He told me that doesn't split orders. I advised him I have been coming there for years and have always taken orders for my coworkers and giving him more business. I find it very hard to believe this is the first time someone has stopped in and asked to split an order up. The cleanliness of the deli has also gone downhill. I ordered ahead and still waiting 15 minutes past the time quoted for pick up. The owner grossly mishandled the situation I was polite and patient so to receive that response I was completely taken aback.
"I really wanted to like this place. Great reviews and a renovated priory--what a great idea! The pictures on the website are beautiful.We found a grumpy old man at the front desk, and he could not have been less interested in our arrival. It felt like we were disturbing him to ask for our room key. But the fun started when we returned later in the evening. We found the rollaway we had requested (and paid for) not present, and I went back down to the old gentleman. He stared at me and then went back to pecking at his computer. I waited. Suddenly he looked up at me and started yelling, something to the effect that there wasn't anything that he could do, and that he would see if someone could do something but probably not. He also angrily admitted that the reservation did show the rollaway.I slunk away with my guest who had by now come down, too, embarrassed and insulted. It shouldn't be this way. If this is personalized service, I'd rather stay at a motel.Even without grumpy old man, there's nothing special about this place. The rooms were ok, but the bathrooms tiny (I guess they should be called showerrooms). Everything else was sub-par. The dining room breakfast was served in was tacky and the coffee awful. We did not dare try the free wine. The hotel is in a bad neighborhood.For the money, find a special at the William Penn on the Omni Hotels website. If you want a boutique hotel, try the Inn on the Mexican War Streets--a beautiful building with friendly owners just across from the National Aviary and that beautiful park. The Priory does not feel boutique and is not worth the hassle.Priory, get grumpy old man out of a customer-facing role."
"We stayed here and was initially disappointed-- being new to town, our first impression was that Pittsburgh was a very very bad town full of homeless and degenerates (the area, I find out later, is one of the worst spots in the city!).  The hotel is located across the street from a housing authority building.  Projects?  UGH.  Great.  Then we were put into a ""historical"" room that was similar to that of a rundown cheap apartment-- old shower stall, moldy threadbare carpeting, lumpy squeaky bed.  I find out an hour later (after freaking out about the lo-end aspect of this room) that they have new rooms that were just recently renovated.  I asked to see the room, and then ultimately change to that room-- for a fee, of course.  About 50% more expensive.  But I pay more because NO WAY would I be able to exist in this old ""historical"" creepy room.  Finally, a regular room-- the ""renovated"" room was similar to that of an acceptable hotel room.  Why even keep this historical, old, dingy, dirty room?  Do they figure unsuspecting people who don't know any better will just accept it b/c they have no other choice?? I slept well in the ""new"" renovated room, and would have been freaked out all night in the old room. What a difference. Actually, the bed and linens were very, very comfortable.  The bathroom was nice and clean.  The room was what I expected a hotel room to be... not high end four seasons, but not cheap and nasty either. The hotel obviously had availabilities of the new, renovated rooms, so why put us in an old, unrenovated, ugly old apartment looking room? If they believed in upgrading, then they would have at least gotten repeat business!! For those who are going to book here, pay more for the new rooms, or go somewhere else.  The option of staying in the old room should not be an option at all.  I don't think I will ever go back here if I ever go back to Pittsburgh.  I will stay at a chain hotel-- marriot or whatever.  What is money except a means to be comfortable and live?  I will spend more next time.Breakfast was ""eh"".  It was free-- small stations of some fruit, cheese, small pastries, cereal, yougurt and two hot items:  sausage + bacon.  OJ, Cranberry, Milk and Coffee also available.  Honestly, I felt like I was in college, and watching my pennies (poor), staying here..."
"Was at a beautiful wedding.  Staff was terrible, unpleasant, and the two slobs at the front desk need to be in the back with their people skills.  Nice hotel but make sure you take some warm bodies with you because the ""people"" at the priory are cold, miserable and just plain miserable. I get better guest service at Holiday Inn"
"We decided to have a little staycation at the Priory earlier this month.  My husband made the reservation with a special they were having for a dinner date night.  With the special, they give you a few Pittsburgh restaurants to choose from and you get a $50 voucher to that restaurant.  When my husband called the Priory, they said they would make the reservations and call us back on the time.  We never got a call about the reservation time which was annoying.  But the main issue was we checked in, talked to the girl at the front desk about having the shuttle take us to this reservation at Meat and Potatoes, and she set us up with the shuttle.  We go in the room, look around for the $50 voucher, and it's not in the room so we assumed (i know we should never assume) that it was taken care of with Meat and Potatoes when they  made our reservation.  We had a fabulous dinner at M&P, great food, great service, and the bill comes.  We asked the server about this Priory $50 voucher and he had never heard about it so the manager comes over and says they didn't give them anything but to have them call and ask for him and he'll work it out.  We called the Priory and told them this, the girl who answered gave us an attitude and said you should have asked for it.  Then refused to call M&P to talk to the manager.  She just said to pay the full bill and we can work it out when we get back to the hotel.  We gave the manager our phone and he was yelled at as well about this.  He took our word that the Priory would deliver it to him the next day and he deducted the $50 from our bill.  It was embarrassing and it wasn't the issue with the money, just the service with the priory.  This showed us two things: We won't be going back to the Priory due to the lack of service and lack of respect and we WILL be going back to M&P because their service was impeccable."
"Horrible food, horrible service. I'm really not sure how this place manages to stay in business."
"I hate to post anything negative,  but seriously, this place was one of the worst.  We weren't expecting top of the line anything,.but everything about this place was bad.  The place was pretty dirty, the coffee was like water, we waited close to an hour for our food (apparently the cook decided to leave for about 45 minutes), the waitress-owner was more interested in drinking beers with another set of customers (at 9:30 in the morning!!) than checking on us.  The food was beyond bad-oh'...and ice cold.  The waitress, the one time she came over, literally spilled.a good amount of coffee on our table and just walked back to her drinking buddies.  It was like getting a shitty breakfast in a local sub dive bar."
"Ron's Pizza Palace is cheap. If the only requirement for your meal is that it costs less than $10, Ron's still wouldn't be your best option.Today I ordered an ""antipasta"" (sic) salad that came with wilted lettuce, thinly sliced, low quality deli meat, rotting carrots, and an overabundance of some shredded white cheese. The entire combination filled slightly more than one quarter of the styrofoam container it came in.On multiple occasions in the past, I have ordered hoagies from Ron's. While I have had enjoyable hoagies from Ron's, that is not the standard experience. The hoagies are very inconsistent in terms of quality, occasionally good, frequently bad. If you get a hoagie, I don't recommend one with produce on it. The produce in their hoagies is as bad as their salads.I won't be ordering from Ron's again, despite the inexpensive menu. I'm all for a cheap meal, but only if a certain standard of quality is met. With Ron's, you are better off considering fast food."
Was going to try the buffalo pizza. Tried to call about 9:15 pm Saturday night and they didn't even pick up the phone. They'er menu says that they are open til 10pm  Disappointed again! No longer going to try.
"I really don't know how this place got any good reviews. One big problem is that the place is dirty, the carpets, the lighting above the tables and the furniture. I have tried this place 5 times in the past 2 years and this is how it went. The 1st time I had a burger which tasted funny and I didn't finish it. I got food poisoning and was so sick. This I thought might have been a stomach flu so I did try this place again. The 2nd time I was with some friends from the neighborhood and 3/5 of us had the spaghetti and meatballs and we got food poisoning.Now I'm thinking that they have a hygiene problem with the ground meat. I was going to stay away from the place but a friend from Troy hill liked to stop there because it was close to her home. No problem,next time I got french fries with gravy. How could this be a problem?.When they got to the table they had put cold canned gravy on my fries.When I told the waitress about it she took it back to the kitchen and microwaved it till it was the heat of lava. Needless to say I refused to pay for them. The 4th time my friend dragged me there, I had a salad. I didn't get sick but it wasn't anything special with bagged salad mix and a couple of under ripe tomato pieces and cucumber. The last time I only got a slice of pie and this was good. I no longer have to go to Billy's, my dear friend has passed away and I refuse to go anywhere near the place. To the owner-Please sell the restaurant, you obviously don't care for the place or know how to handle food safely."
"Well, my update is that this place has been sold and new owners are going to give it a shot. I am excitedly awaiting a grand opening for the new place. My first hope is that they will steam clean the whole place to start. I will try it no matter what kind of place it is because I try to support local businesses."
"How to put this gently?While I may go back to Pittsburgh some day, I will never return to the Carnegie Museum of Art. It's not that I mind that its gallery seemed small compared to others I have viewed (sometimes small museums have some hidden treasures) or that one whole gallery was blown glass and I felt like I was at a bong shop on haight st. in sf. It comes down to the fact that a docent, while trying to explain a painting with a watchtower in it, told the students it was a watchtower ""from Auschwitz, a place where they basically fried a lot of Jews"".  Seriously? That's how she chose to describe concentration camps to a large class of what I could only guess were middle schoolers? It sounded like she described a bad breakfast joint...""oh that place? they basically just fry eggs"".On top of all that, the description of the piece stated the watchtower was reminiscent of those that were spread throughout East and West Germany during Hitler's rule (i.e. not those in Auschwitz).In sum, docents are a reflection of the institution in which they volunteer, and this one sucked. So, Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, if you're going to hire racist people to lead your tours, at least make sure they have their facts straight (or can read)."
"At this point, I am done. I scheduled my kids for the last 2 weeks in August and then due to an emergency, I had to cancel, which I did a month before their camp was to start. I was told they were issuing my refund, and that was 3 weeks ago. THREE WEEKS and i still dont have it. I live probably 30 minutes from the museum and could have driven there 63838484848485858 times by now and picked it up. Its just sooo unprofessional and annoying. They need to get their office together and deliver refunds in a timely manner. 7-10 business days are fine but 3 WEEKS is UNACCEPTABLE for it to not have even been MAILED YET. So dissapointed and will never use them again."
"In response to the response I received from the Museum rep, I called and left a message and never received a reply as of yet, but you reponded on Yelp. This week is the 3rd week. your response stated that my refund was sent this week, if you are speaking about this current week, today is the 14th, monday and the week has just begun. If you are talking about last week, can you please tell me what day since leaving messages do not gain a response except to be contacted here on Yelp. Thank you."
"Estimated delivery time 45 minutes actually delivery time 120 minutes.Pizza Hut , a pizza of last resort."
Delivery time was 11:30. Called at 12 to check on my order and was told it was just going in the oven and would be another 45 minutes to an hour until it was delivered. Told them to just cancel the order. And they got an attitude with me about it. Not to mention in the past they couldn't even bring me my entire order.
"Estimated delivery time from an online order: 120 min. Called to make sure it was actually out for delivery, guy says ""Our estimated delivery time is actually 2 hours."" I should've just picked up an hour ago -_-Don't bother with delivery here. Carry out is your best bet."
Complete and total joke. TERRIBLE service. TERRIBLE management. TERRIBLE product. Do yourself a favor avoid this place. Because of the fact this Pizza Hut is allowed to exist by Pizza Hut standard and be the complete shit hole that it is for years I vow to never consume Pizza Hut ever again.
"If I could give this restaurant a zero, I would. We were just asked by our waitress to leave because someone with a reservation was waiting for our table. My father and father-in-law were still finishing up their coffee and we had not yet finished our dessert! I've never been so humiliated. Do NOT go to this restaurant!Their food was mediocre at best. If you want excellent Italian in a small intimate restaurant, go to Dish on the South Side. I will not be going back."
"Went for the first and last time tonight. Made reservations for 3. Restaurant thought we said 2 and acted like we lied. $12 corkage fee for 1 bottle of wine. Asked to leave when we finished eating, because they needed the table, on a Thursday night. Food was OK, but not even close to making up for all the other problems. I can easily get a good meal elsewhere for those prices, with better service."
"The best thing about this place is Sam. The worst thing about this place is also Sam.What was great was that Sam made me feel at home and treated me like someone he had known for a long time. He took me to the back of his warehouse, gave me a free beer to drink, and engaged me in plenty of conversation. At one point, though, he said, ""You look oriental, but you also look American."" I'm pretty sure he wasn't meaning for it to be offensive, and I just discounted it as his being an old man who didn't know it was no longer politically correct to say things like that.This is not why I recommend against Caruso's, however. The reason why I'll never go there again is because Sam knowingly sold me expired beer.I was on my way back from the North Side to the East End where I live and after seeing these good reviews, I decided to stop by. I wanted a case of Yuengling, but Sam said, ""Why don't you try this instead,"" and popped open a fresh bottle of Castello, an Italian beer. He had me drink it, all the while espousing its comparative taste to Yuengling at a cheaper price point. It certainly tasted alright, and a case of it was a couple dollars less than what Yuengling was going for.Since the Castello tasted fine, I ended up buying a case of it on Sam's recommendation. A few days later when I opened the box and drank a couple of the beers, however, I noticed that they tasted funny. That's when I looked at the label and saw how each of the bottles had its ""sell by"" date marked out in black Sharpie. You could see the numbers underneath the Sharpie, and the dates were for well over two years ago. So basically, Sam had convinced me to buy something he hadn't been able to sell, knowing that I lived in the East End and probably wasn't going to visit again anyway.Stale beer aside, there's another big reason not to go to Caruso's: Their prices are steep--$24 for a case of Yuengling. While Sam might be a more charming character than the young folks at my neighborhood distributor Pistella's, at least I know that Pistella's has significantly lower prices and actually has enough customers and product turnover that they won't purposely sell me something that's not fresh."
"The most dysfunctional subway I have ever been to.  I am in outside sales and eat at subway at least once a week throughout the pittsburgh area and surrounding.I ordered a Tuscan chicken salad and you would have thought I asked them to paint the sisteen chapel!  The fountain drinks are cheapened by less syrup and more soda water.  The sweet tea is also cheapened with hardly any sugar.The only redeeming quality is the young girl who works here.  She is very polite even when asking a peer for help with ringing up my order.  The peer got all up in arms about how they never trained them to do that.  The young girl politely asked for a moment, sought out who I believe to be the owner/manager and came back promptly with a solution.I don't expect much from subway to begin with and this location is a far cry from bare minimum."
Does not honor National Sub Day offer. They tell you JUST as you are about to pay. Too late to back out. WTF?
"Awful.  I didn't know how bad it was until I went to a different GE and saw how good it could be.  The lines are long, the produce selection is minimal, and the store is overcrowded.The last straw was yesterday when the cashier blew her nose, stuck kleenex up her nose, then put it back in her pocket and continued to scan groceries.  When I complained to the manager, they denied any of their employees were sick.I'm done shopping at this store."
"This Giant Eagle maybe the worst supermarket I've ever been to. There are thugs hanging out by the entrance and in the parking lot. The interior is dark and dank and has an outdated ""made in the 70s"" feel. With options like this I don't have a problem taking the extra time to drive to Trader Joe's."
"Scariest/shadiest grocery store experience in my life. Hubby and I pulled in only to see a few cars down, people selling who-knows-what out of their car trunk. Also this is the only Giant Eagle tht gives you a really hard time if you ever forget your advantage card and give your phone no instead (it works at the other ones just fine). Then we leave by waiting for a really dazed/swaying woman to finish wandering around back and forth in front of us, and pass by a drive-by fat cash exchange (drugs?) on our way out of the parking lot. We are definitely scared to return, and will never need grapes (or any other groceries) so desperately again."
"The store reeks of rotting fish, the security guards watch you like a hawk and the food selection is the worse I've seen in any Giant Eagle in the city.One plus if you must shop here there are plenty of jitney drivers waiting for you to come out to offer you a ride.  That can be a big help if you are like me and don't have a car. ""Need a car"" haha some things about living in the hood just never change. With this being the closet G E to Downtown and PNC Park and Heinz field I would think they would renovate but it's been years and still no change."
"Awful.  Worst grocery store I've ever been to.  To make it worse, they are supposed to open at 7.  At 7:10, I was told they were ""still getting ready to open"" and I should come back ""around 7:30"""
The store has a weird rotting meat smell sometimes. The selection isn't amazing but there are a few interesting items here. As other people commented there are always people hanging around outside.... But they are friendly at least to me! One thing I like about the store is the proximity to my house. The biggest let down is the sky high prices that I think GE is notorious for... I miss Kroger
"So I got a call from Giant Eagle asking me to give my opinion of this store. My recommendation was to burn this place to the ground. Buckle up for crappy produce, rotten fish, old meat, and security guards that speck you be stealin! This is the Gh**to Eagle!"
"It smells funky in here.  On a positive note, its usualy fully stocked and there is an INDOOR redbox. My debit card numbers were hacked by a skimmer at the Shadyside Get Go. Every last dollar was spent in 1 hour at a Bed Bath & Beyond so i barely use redbox.. and if i do it has to be at an indoor location like this one. The skimming can still happen but i feel a little more at ease.Oh and their check cashing system is hit or miss. Its different from other GE's so they use their own system. The last two times we were here, the system declined bobbys check. Waste of time. I dont even bother coming here anymore. All bad news."
Went to this store today and it was worse than usual . Jitneys were all parked up in the handicapped parking spaces because it was raining. The one guy was walking back to his car next to me and as he pulled his keys out of his pocket a baggie corner filled with some brown stuff fell out right in front of me. I had seen him pocket something from a man that sits at the driveway exit. He did pick it up really fast. Then I saw a young man in a tie from the store go over to the guy that was selling this stuff and they shook hands and were laughing and yacking with each other  This is in the middle of the day. I'm too scared to shop there after dark.
The problem with this dry cleaner is poor counter service.  I have never been treated in such a poor manner - and the sad part is that this SERVICE provider doesn't care.  I recommend going elsewhere.  They are not worth my money.
"So I take my 501's to #pfennigs cleaners on the North Dide in Pittsburgh the way I have for 6 years. Not every week but when I know it's time to get them dry cleaned. I took 5 or 6 pairs.....3 I can still wear, 2 I can't even button them up. I knew something different happened. They shrunk so terribly that I felt it only right to ask them to reimburse me for the jeans.The owner Mr. Pfennig, gets on the phone when I called and said......whatever.....excuse me while I scream...... I work in a department that saves customers from leaving because of financial issues, service issues and reps who are rude to customers that have been with us for less than the 6 years I was a customer at this cleaners. If I said whatever to a customer more than likely it would get escalated, customer would disconnect service or with the new guidelines.....fired I would be.It gets better......I walk over to the cleaners to speak to them and show them the work they did and was further insulted by Me. Pfennig when he said well my wife doesn't remember you and you brought these in on the 4th of January...it's the new year maybe your body changed. If I was 18 I would have beat his ass over that. Like who goes from 38's to 42's in 7 days? I even showed him the same size jeans that were done correctly and he still would not visually acknowledge that the cleaners shrunk my clothes! I told him that 2 pics, a hashtag and Twitter would fix this. It's a new day and age and for someone who supports small business to be treated and talked to this way is no longer acceptable.The sad part of this was I would have continued being a customer if he had reimbursed me $90 for 2 pair of 501's that I purchased on sale from Macy's. I see the one thing that stands out in these reviews is the owners lack of customer service skills. I will never give them another penny and the money I spend going elsewhere will be worth it.#badcleaners"
Horrible customer service! Owner takes no responsibility for ruining clothing. He will blame everyone else before apologizing. I may not be the highest paying customer but I deserved at the very least an apology.
Our bartender didn't know what a pint was or how to pour a beer
"The worst customer service ever!!!!!!! When I told my stylist which design I wanted, she proceeded to say that the stat wouldn't look right on a shorter nail. she then offered to do a Freestyle  design on my nails which was horrible I did not like it at all. I told her then that I change my mind that did not want to design and she got a attitude when I asked for my money back for the design. She couldn't talk to other customers about the predicament comparing our situation to one at the restaurant. I will never ever come back to this establishment because not only do they do poor work they are rude and disrespectful."
"STAY AWAY...We've been 3 times over the past few years, each time we say ""let's try it again"" followed by ""wish we'd done something else"".Reminds me of the movie line ""Run away, run very far away""Last nite after Steelers/Jets was last straw. I hope the owner or general manager reads this. And think the health department should too.Service is mediocre and slow. consistently. Waitress was ok in attitude.After our soup starter (good french onion soup) we waited and waited and waited and waited for our mains. Noticing us staring at her, waitress stopped by, went into kitchen, came back and said we were next. my watch said 8:31. Then her manager came by and argued with me and said we were next, then at 8:52pm the horrible food finally arrived. That's 21 minutes to be next. In that time we watched 4 tables turn from being seated to drinks to mains to check down while we waited for our main. Manager embarrassed himself. Said they were busy and working our food and he had checked and would come soon. I told him about the 4 tables turning and he said no they didn't. then I said I used to manage restaurants and know what customer service and ticket times are and he challenged me and said no I didn;t and I had no idea what I was talking about. What an idiot! First rule of restaurant business is the customer is always right.Then the food arrived. How hard is it to do chicken marsala with mushrooms, seriously? It was two soggy fried chicken tenders from the deep fryer (not pan sauteed) over a bowl of bowtie pasta with shrooms and a sauce. While the sauce did have some marsala in it, it was full of sour cream and tasted like stroganoff and a little funny. The Penne ala vodka was sauteed canned tomatoes and no flavor. We were so hungry we ate most and left.1 hour later I was sick on the side of the road from the dinner and still feel really rough this morning."
"Ugh, I hate this place.  People from work drag me here to lunch more often than I would like.  The food is overpriced.  The service is snotty and slow.  I can barely get free in under an hour-and-a-half.  The food is forgettable and the menu sparse.  They're terrible for pick-up too - even when you call way ahead, you're made to wait, and they're surly about taking care of you when you arrive for your food.  You can do better for lunch on the northshore pretty much anywhere.  Try SoHo or Finnegan's instead."
"Here before Bucs VICTORY OVER THE CARDS in game 3 of the NLDS, a Sunday. Game at 4:30, got here at 2:30. Packed both inside and out. Can't comment on any other time but this really hectic one. Ordered Pepsi and brisket nachos. AWFUL. Soggy chips, some shredded beef drenched in sweet generic BBQ sauce, a blanket of cold congealed cheese spotted with jalapeÌ±o slices. Not a degree above room temp. Will give them 1 star for tasty Pepsi and keeping it filled."
"ok, i don't want to judge all atria's by this one. in fact, i wouldn't even judge this atria's solely by this one experience. but let me tell you, i was highly disappointed.i will point out the good parts of the night first. we arrived to see a band play. the entertainment was great, didn't cost extra (although there was a $20 minimum per person), and i liked the set up in the room where they played. also, the soup i got (crab bisque) was delicious!ok, now, for the rest of the experience. first of all, our service was AWFUL. i don't know our server's name, and i know some of the wait wasn't his fault, as there was a large party upstairs. but it took at least ten minutes to even order our drinks, another 15 before we even got them. ten more minutes before we could order our food, and after the meal, we must have waited at least 15 if not 20 minutes for our check before one of the members in our party finally had to go up to our waiter and complain. i saw him checking on other tables, and it didn't seem like he had many tables to keep him so busy. as a server, myself, i always give my servers the benefit of the doubt, but it really got to be too much. the one thing i will say for him though, was that he was very nice. but for how much we waited, we should have had something comped or at least got some sort of apology BEFORE we had to complain.the rest of the food and drinks were okay. good, but not enough to make up for the service. i had the berry mojito to drink and the greek salad to eat.i'd try another atria's before i'd go back to this one. but now i'm weary of the restaurant all together."
I came here on the Fourth of July after getting off of work. My friend and I stopped for one drink before the fireworks. Let's just say I will never return. I stood there for a good 15 minutes with maybe 5 people tops at the bar. The bartenders never once acknowledged me yet they did manage to make eye contact. They then all walked out from behind the bar and went outside. It took another ten minutes until finally the manager came over and served me. I am a bartender and I am appalled to see such people being employed at what seems like a decent place. I am a phenomenal tipper being that I am in the industry and sadly I didn't leave a single dollar. Hopefully they can learn from their mistakes instead of probably losing more potential customers.  What a shame.
"After eating lunch several days a week at Atrias PNC Park restaurant for many years, I have finally decided that the price has just lost any relation to portions/quality and will not be dining there anytime in the near future.Gradually, over the past year, the prices have continued to increase to the point of being dinner menu prices for lunch size meals.  Recently, the portion size has significantly diminished, to the point of being almost comical today.The fish ""special"" today was BBQ salmon with asparagus.  It consisted of about 3oz of salmon and four spears of asparagus.  It actually looked ridiculous on the plate.  The specials used to have 5-6 oz of fish, included a decent portion of vegetables, and rice, all for a dollar or two less.  While a bit more than I wanted to spend for lunch, at least the quality and size of portion made some sense.  Today, I spent $15 plus tax and tip and left feeling like I had eaten an appetizer and still hungry.They have pushed it too far, I am no longer willing to waste my money at Atria's.  Too bad, we used to really enjoy lunch there."
"I was meeting up with 3 other people there. But I was a few minutes late.  Because I wasn't there at the time,  they refused to seat the others.  Not even to just get drinks or an appetizer ordered.  So they left to go to some place that would serve them (Dominic's)  This place clearly couldn't be bothered to have our business,  which seems like an odd way to run an organization.  One star because we didn't get anything that we wanted."
"When you walk into a buzzing restaurant, you'd expect to be greeted by someone, be that a server, a greeter or the bartender. I went in last night, stood around for almost 10 minutes, and was completely ignored. I was meeting a few friends, so I decided to walk across the street and grab a beer and make a reservation (using open table) for 45 minutes later.  Reservation confirmed, and beer finished, I walk back over, walk in to the place and someone's at the computer in the entryway on the phone. He finishes, we make eye contact, he nods and walks away. My friends come in, we wait 10 minutes for someone who works there to talk to us. I tell her we have reservations, she acts like it can't happen, and that it's my mistake, she says that the place is closed for a private party. I ask why there isn't a sign on the door saying 'closed for private party', and I get a ridiculous answer that the ""CEO doesn't like us to do that"". How dumb is that: you leave your system open to make reservations and you don't alert people that might be going to a show on the north shore that the place is closed. The fake sincerity is what really got me. You know what a 'private party' sign does? It advertises that you are available for private parties, and would have given me an hour to figure out other arrangements."
"I was here on a business dinner and it firmly seated itself as the absolute WORST place I've ever eaten at. -hair in the food-crab cakes were touted as amazing, in reality disgusting ice cream scoops of poor crab and mayonnaise -""risotto"" uncooked and congealed to plate. -vegetables gummy and soaked in oil. Not properly prepped and served with woody stems. I was shocked this place turns a profit"
"Before a Pirates game we stopped in to get a bite. I ordered a hamburger with fries for $13.00. Very disappointed. It took over 30 minutes to get the order. The meat was very dry and falling apart but not over cooked. This tells me that they added ""filler"", usually bread, to stretch the meat and pump profits. I've had juicier meat and larger patty at Wendy's for a sixth of the price. Overall...I would not go back to Atria's."
"Just went to this restaurant to try and have dinner and the guy that sat us was very nice but after waiting 10 minutes with no sign of a server my husband finally asked if they could send someone to wait on us and they said they would. Waited another 5 minutes and no one showed up so we got up and left. Awful place, to bad I was looking forward. We only wish we would have ordered food and then left."
"This is not a review about the food or service at Atria's, which I have always found more than satisfactory, but rather about their handling of our reservation.  I had wanted to dine at Atria's for their Oktoberfest menu, and with Saturday night being the last of October, I made reservations for a friend and I at the PNC Park location.  Just to be sure, I called the restaurant and asked if the location was featuring the Oktoberfest menu.  The girl who answered assured me that they were. When we checked in, I again asked if they were doing the Oktoberfest menu, and again was assured they were although they did not give me the special menu which was sitting next to the regular menu at the host's podium.I didn't see any of the Oktoberfest specials listed on the menu, so I asked our server, a pleasant young man named Qwan about it.  He told me that the O specials were listed in a box on the lower left hand corner of the menu.  When I questioned the skimpy selection given there, he told me that they were not featuring the entire Oktoberfest menu on weekends at that location, but only a selection of appetizers and small plates.  He told me that all other locations were featuring the whole menu.   He seemed surprised and disinclined to believe me when I told him that that was not satisfactory, especially in light of the fact I had called to check and had been told that the special menu was being offered, and that we would be leaving. I got on Open Table and secured a reservation for dinner at their Wexford location, a half-hour's drive out of town. I didn't speak to anyone from the restaurant's management because we had to leave to make our reservation time at the Wexford location.It is certainly any restaurant's right to serve whatever menu or part of a menu they wish, but they should also inform people when they call if they are not honoring the complete published special menu advertised.  The food and service at the Wexford location were acceptable other than a spinach salad that arrived only after I had asked about it and without the warm sweet and sour dressing advertised on the menu.  They had also run out of the apple strudel that was on the menu, but that's always a chance you take on a popular menu item."
"We had to go through these people to pay rent for our crap-hole apartment. One day we got a notice that the house was going up for Sheriffs Auction. We immediately talked to the people here and they told us not to worry- the same thing has happened before and the owner took care of it. So we think nothing of it (we were college kids and it was our first apartment).A few months later we come home to find a 30 days notice on our front door. We were never informed by the landlord or the this real estate company that the house was under control of the city even though we were at the real estate office several times to pay rent and to check on the status of things. We had between paying rent that entire time that it was actually sold in the Sheriffs Auction. That is $600  month from August to March.Of course, no matter how much we screamed and complained, we never got one cent back, nor did the downstairs neighbor. They probably knew we wouldn't have the money for a lawyer. Gotta love these companies that prey on people.Just ask around Pittsburgh. Most people know of this company and the first thing out of their mouths are: ""Please tell me you're not renting from those slum-lords.""."
"I had the worst experience with those people last year...i had bed bugs in the apartment (702 james street)...we were complaining...and the guy called bruce didn't even listen ....when i left the apartment...i cleaned everything, but he did not give me all the deposit back...saying that he payed somebody to clean it(bulshit). And he charged me  for taking off some portraits off the wall that i left there...but he did not do that cause i still can see the portraits  from east ohio street (layer)...the worst unprofessional real estat company..."
"Those of you with small children may want to reconsider taking them to the Pittsburgh Children's Museum.  We went for the first time today, and a staff member was running and JUMPED OVER my 17 month old as if she were at a track meet and my toddler was a hurdle. My daughter could have easily been kicked in the head. I doubt we'll be returning anytime soon!"
"Don't risk it. Never open when you need it, unreliable availability with his products. He offered to reserve some for me until it was done cooking and then when I returned on time he had already sold it. I was excited to try it for the first time but won't waste my effort in the future if this is how customer service is handled. There are other BBQ places that actually have food to serve."
"1 star for your cover-2 defense that lost me $100 on the Super Bowl.  I thought yall were going to shut down Fitzgerald.  You disappointed me.  Wouldn't have mattered if that Big Ben TD didn't get called back and turned into a field goal, but damn your cover-2 D that let Fitz run wild on yall.National Fixed League on them spread busters.  Vegas owns the NFL!  Sheiiit!!!"
"It's cathartic to give this sorry organization 1 star.Note: this is a review of the baseball club, not the stadium in which they play"
"Ugh!  Another losing season.  WTF man, weren't we in first place at the All-Star Break?  What happened?  I wasn't expecting a World Series Champ or even a Pennant winner.  But was a winning season too much to ask for?  This marks the 20th anniversary since the Pirates' last winning season.  That's right folks--it's been since 1992.  Let's take a look at the world of 1992.BASEBALL:  The Pirates' roster that year included Stan Belinda, Doug Drabek, Zane Smith, Denny Neagle, Jay Bell, Orlando Merced, Andy Van Slyke, and of course Barry Bonds.  All have since retired.  The only new ballparks were New Comiskey Park (now U.S. Cellular Field) and Camden Yards.  No stadiums had corporate names.  The Arizona Diamondbacks, the Colorado Rockies, the Miami Marlins, and the Tampa Bay (Devil) Rays didn't exist.  The Washington Nationals were the Montreal Expos.  The Milwaukee Brewers were in the AL.  Both the NL and the AL only had two divisions each.  The minor league Washington Wild Things didn't exist either and nor did their league.  KBL was the big cable sports channel.TV:  ""Saturday NIght Live's"" cast included Dana Carvey, Ellen Cleghorne, Chris Farley, Tim Meadows, Mike Myers, Kevin Nealon, Phil Hartman,  Chris Rock, Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider, and David Spade.  ""Seinfeld"" hadn't become a huge hit yet and no one knew Kramer's first name.  Monday nights on NBC included ""Murphy Brown"", ""Evening Shade"" and "" Northern Exposure"".MOVIES:  The top movies included ""Lethal Weapon 3"", ""Basic Instinct"", ""Hone Alone 2"", ""The Bodyguard"" and ""Aladdin"".  When you wanted to watch movies at home, you had to rent them from the video store and you watched them on VHS tapes or laserdiscs.  MUSIC:  Bruce Springsteen released ""Lucky Town"" and ""Human Touch""  on the same day.  R.E.M. had ""Automatic for the People"".  Gin Blossoms released their first album ""New Miserable Experience"", which stayed on the charts for almost two years.  Bare Naked Ladies ""Gordon"" featured the cult classic ""If I Had a Million Dollars.""  You either listened to albums on cassette or CD and you bought them at record stores like National Record Mart.  Doug Hopkins (Gin Blossoms), Kurt Cobain (Nirvana), Shannon Hoon (Bline Melon) and Jerry Garcia (Grateful Dead) were all alive.TECHNOLOGY:  Few people had internet access.  You also used pay phones because you didn't have a cell phone.  You watched movies on a VCR.  You met up with your friends without texting them.  You ordered merchandise by ""sending in"" or by calling an ""800"" number.  You had to buy tickets by waiting in line.  And OJ Simpson was still a football hero.So that's it, Pittsburgh Pirates.  I feel like telling you I'm done with you guys.  I'm no fair weather fan, but 20+ years of losing is enough."
I think it's a shame that the Pittsburgh Pirates company does nothing with African American children EVER.  I  go to games and have tried to get them involved in some of the programs the Pirates have and they are NEVER choosen. Every game all I see is non African American kids. They love the Pirates too. PNC Park need to do better by us.
"I was raised Catholic (but no longer practice), and have always been fascinated by relics and the stories of saints--so I was really looking forward to our tour of St Anthony's. BEWARE: I can't speak for their other guides, but the gentleman (a lay person, not a priest) who ""led"" ours was far more interested in haranguing the crowd on the nature of TRUE believers, the infallibility of the Catholic faith, and whether we'd all found our ""charisms"" - the gifts we needed to be using if we were going to be saints, too--than showing us any relics. After an hour of his sermon--and nary a single fact about the hundreds of relics that surrounded us--we left. What a disappointment. What a huckster."
"So, this is what happened.I went their complaining about a possible over heating and requesting a change of oil. This was my first visit there. They topped off my coolant for free and changed my oil. I had a check engine light on for which I knew the code and was holding off on repairing it. They charged me $20 for reading the check engine light code and turning it off. I didn't want that. I pointed this out on the bill and he said that, its fine, I can just pay for the oil change (~$42). He asked me if I had $42 cash on me. If I did, I could have paid and left a happy customer. But I didn't, so I gave him my card and he went in the back and swiped it for the full price ($42 + $20 + tax). When I was signing the transaction receipt, I told him that he swiped for the full price. This apparently pissed him off a lot, he very rudely handed $20 from his pocket and asked me to ""Get out of there"" - and walked out. I tried to talk to him and explain my reason of asking - it not being the matter of $20 but of the principle that he said he wasn't going to charge me for what I didn't want. But he wouldn't listen, was very rude and said ""You're Done"" and ""Get out"" more times. I left. I ain't going back where they treat customers like that."
"Nick's used to be good with the previous owner, that all changed. Which is pretty sad."
"I remember going here when I was a little kid to celebrate my grandparents' 50th wedding anniversary.  I thought this place was ""fancy"" of so many years ago and I remember going out back to play in the nearby park and I also thought that was really cool.  When I moved to Pittsburgh, I moved to Brighton Heights where Miller's is located but I only went once a few years ago and it was just ok.  I decided to give it another shot the other night and I really regret it.  I ordered the fried fish sandwich and even though it was crisp on the outside to the point of being somewhat burnt yet the inside was cold and the fish just had a weird texture like maybe it was freezer burnt or really old.  The place is dingy and poorly lite, it looks dirty and the overall experience was just downright unpleasant.  No, just no.  That is all."
"Ordered a lg pizza for pick up, 30-40 min wait. Went to pick up my pizza and I arrived to have no pizza at all. They told a driver must have taken by accident. The skinny, is it took an hour for a new pizza, and they offered me nothing"
"Terrible. I lived about 2 blocks away - and with no other options - I still can't bring myself to order from here. Ordered twice in the last 90 days and both times it was terrible. Ended up waiting over an hour each time. First time I got home to find a totally different order; the send time waited over 1.5 hrs for a pizza. Both were crappy, at best. Staff was really rude both times."
"I really loved the food and some of the employees. But WOW did that manager make a mistake speaking to me the way he did over a 1.5 hour delivered pizza ( I live 7 blocks) with unmelted cheese and wings with no sauce. "" heat up your pizza and I'll bring some sauce down in an hour "" not the response a customer ever wants to hear. It's a shame. All it would have take n was a new pizza and wings. $20 a week plus gone from them."
I cant believe I requested a snail mail menu so my building could decide on a new caterer for our lunches and dinners and received 0 our tenant council is still looking for a new caterer since another Disastrous thanksgiving dinner w another caterer.! I cant believe no menu requested even gave you my phone# & address and 1 month 0 thank you for 0 and I will tell council not to use you since we didn't get menu w prices or foods. This job would of been for every holidays that we have lunches or dinners
"Very disappointed. Delivery was late, our gyros were cold and fries were soggy. I wont be ordering from here again."
"This was probably the worst Gyro I have ever had.  Even the frozen ones sold in supermarkets are better than this.  Extremely dry, tasteless, and obviously not fresh as I watched the woman cut from the very top of the thin spindly piece of meat left and then microwave it before serving me.  I will never go back to this place nor will I recommend it.   Stay away, Gross and distasteful"
"Stopped in for an oil change and they told me they couldn't open the hood. Went up the road to Jifffy Lube and they had no problem opening the hood and gave me a discount. Sorry Pennzoil, i think you lost a customer."
Had a friend who went here. REALLY BAD experience
"I had an appointment there, showed up, and the hair dresser didn't even show up! The owner is the one who took my appointment. Somehow it got lost? They are a hot mess. I will never go here again!"
"I came in tonight ready to buy a bike.  In fact, I called to see if they had the specific bike I was looking for.  There were plenty of workers there, and I waited around for ten minutes before I left.  I was really disappointed.  It was only when I was leaving when a guy asked me if I needed help.  Maybe it was because I am a woman?  The only people getting help in there tonight were two other guys.  What a terrible experience.  I'm glad I took my money elsewhere."
"Coffee and atmosphere are great... but my God, the cupcakes are the worst EVER!!!  There is a bakery right beside them; they should really consider selling the bakery's sweets or none at all.  I think a fake/display cupcake would have been fresher... and maybe even taste better.  Yes, it was that bad!  Mr. Manager... try your stuff before you sell it!"
"I bought a latte.....no wait! Actually, I bought coffee and espresso and two lattes and something to munch on (not all for me I had a friend with me). When I ordered the 2nd latte I sat down and realized I didn't have any foam so went back to the counter to ask for some and and she wanted to charge me!? Really!? Maybe it sound petty to you but I like my lattes fixed a certain way and foam is the best part! It's all about customer service and considering I had just spent over $25.00 a little foam wasn't much to ask. Good coffee. Bad customer service."
"This was my second visit and alas, my last. Our first visit was at lunch and it was just OK. We weren't blown away nor were we impressed. But I will always opt to support a local Mom & Pop shop if all things are equal. This last visit was the pits.It was 5:30pm on a Saturday night. We were one of two tables. This is usually an indication of something fishy (excuse the pun.) Appetizer was edamame. It was overcooked and left uneaten. I am not the adventurous sushi order-er; I had California rolls and spicy tuna. The tuna rolls were mostly spicy sauce then fish, very mayonnaise-y and unsatisfying. As for my CA rolls, the avocado was all brown! Not just the parts on the top (because I checked!) all the way through. When I brought it to the staff's attention her response was ""Oh, yea. Avocado is like banana. They get brown very easily and we cut that yesterday."" WHAT?!? They did bring me another batch (that was part brown, part green) but it was too late. This was my first sushi restaurant EVER that we left half the rolls on the plate uneaten. Since we were all still hungry, my daughter picked up the table tent listing all the desserts. Yuck! Filthy. Not wiped down in a long while or perhaps ever. When I set it back is when I noticed the wall also needed a good wipe down. Needless to say, we skipped dessert. Our first visit deserved a 2.5 but this visit was a 1."
Horrible food. It's hard to get a good Chinese restaurant around Pittsburgh. I wouldn't recommend to my dog
"Such a shame.   Hire and run enough staff on a Saturday night to take care of your customers.   2 servers at 8:30pm with 14 tables may be good for labor % but after 3 decades of making Tom's diner in Dormont a stop whenever I'm nearby,  this is the last time I will be here.   10 minutes to be acknowledged,  5 more to get the drinks (there were 2 of us), 30 minutes for the soup,  followed closely by our sandwiches. ...And I watch the other customers faces....all confused as I am as to what's going wrong in here...who is running the place?  Does anyone who owns the place actually care?"
"Haven't eaten here in 15 years.  Will be another 15 till I go back.  Worst diner breakfast food ever.  How can you make an omelet and potatoes taste bad?  Ask the cook here, he has it down pat.  Coffee was good, service was good, nothing else was, even down to the fruit flies flying up my nose."
This once was a great place once! The mighty have fallen sad. The gyros there use to be amazing. Smh
Vasta went down hill since the 90's....... They need to attract a different kind of crowd They need to change things up a lot.......  If you want any idea's hit me up I could give your business many ideas how to flip your business around. Hit me up tiffanyshousekeeping@yahoo.com
"Read my first review... loved this place... Today I stopped in to look around,my niece was with me and I remembered that they had help wanted postings somewhere.. she inquired and the teenage girl behind the counter was SO rude, full on glaring and rolling of the eyes! NO JOKE. I wish that the manager had been in but hopefully she keeps track and knows what her counter staff is like when she is gone! I will go to party Cake shop from here on...There are too many great places to put up with attitude!"
"Pastries are nice but I bought a cake for my sisters bridal shower and they PUT THE WORDING ON THE CAKE INCORRECTLY! it was a Saturday and ""could not call a baker in to fix it so they could refund me the cake and just take this one, go somewhere else to buy a new cake, or try to fix the writing ourselves and just remove the word that was INCORRECT."" I spent hours on the phone with the manager and she was not very helpful or empathetic to the situation.  I then went to go pick up another cake for my sister for her husbands birthday and THE CAKE TOPPLED OVER IN THE BOX IN THEIR OWN FRIDGE!  I asked the lady if this happens often and she goes nope your just ""special"".  Being really rude about it.  They patched the cake up and THEN showed me the cake and THERE WAS A WOODEN STAKE IN THE CAKE to ""keep it together"".  I then said that there is a hole in the cake now and the counter lady said, ""Just smooth the hole over with your finger a little bit."" The counter girls are always rude.  I honestly think they don't like me because they are nice to everyone else but myself. But if I would suggest I would NOT go here."
"We were having a Gender Naming Party for our first baby and we were excited to share this moment with friends and family. When we went to pick up our cake we were extremely disappointed in the way the staff handled our order. The mother to be on picking up the cake found out the gender of the baby! Without her husband! This was supposed to be a surprise at the party but it was on the receipt. How terrible! They knew when we placed the order that this was supposed to be a secret. When confronted with their error they were dismissive, condescending, and there was no effort to compensate her for her pain in finding out the gender at the bakery. We have done wedding cakes here, and many special events over the years. Never again!! Potomac Bakery you should be ashamed."
"Like frozen cake? How about horrible customer service? If so Potomac is the horrible place for your next event...Long time customer and disappointed to say will not buy from them again. Bought a specialty cake for pick-up over the weekend for my 3yr. old son's birthday. Went to cut the cake for the birthday party and it was frozen in the middle. I called to let them know and they told me they would have a manager call me on Monday and there was nothing they could do for me that day since they didn't have any other cakes unfrozen. Not the end of the world I thought and we would just have to eat the cake the next day. Then about 15 minutes later received a phone call back from Potomac telling me I had to return the uneaten portions of the cake and get a partial refund- I was floored. They messed up here not having my cake ready yet I had to return the cake for a PARTIAL refund for what wasn't eaten??? Absolutely horrible way to treat a customer when they were the ones in error. I explained that I disagreed with this policy and they should be making an effort to correct the situation of sending me a cake that wasn't ready, they explained that this was their policy and were not willing to work with me. I expected a call Monday from management apologizing for their staff handling the situation incorrectly but never was called. Apparently they feel that frozen cakes are acceptable for events. Sad part is that I have always loved their cakes and pastries but based on their views towards their customers will NOT be going back.Thanks for the disappointment to me and my son!"
This place is the worst motel I have ever stayed. Do NOT stay here!!!!
This was the worst hotel that I ever stayed in. my hubby and I  took the smoking room and it stunk sooo bad that I wanted to throw up. I was afraid to sleep in that nasty bed. in the morning at 5am I wanted to leave the room cuz smell was sooo gross that woke me up! I felt so dirty that I took two showers AT Other HOTEL. I never thought that I will have nightmares bcz of bad and stinky hotel.
"I've never been to Pittsburgh before and I planned on doing some heavy partying and needed a place to crash that was not on the floor so I booked this hotel the day before I drove up. I saw the reviews & ignored them because I figured I'd be drunk and happy enough to dive into a bed.I checked in around 2am, the girl who checked me in barely said anything to me besides ""initial here and sign here and your room is over there"". The room smelt like hot dogs, the AC wasn't working at all so I was dripping in sweat all night, none of the lamps worked at all, there were holes in the pillow cases and bedding, there was a tiny blood stain on the sheet, I went down for the continental breakfast at 9:30am (it ends at 10am) and they already stopped serving, the shower was ice cold. I then checked for bed bugs after realizing the shithole I spent the night in last night (coast is clear). I checked out and went back to Baltimore, which seems like heaven on earth compared to Shittsburgh."
"BED BUGS!!! Horrible place! DO NOT STAY HERE!! Stayed here for a wedding we attended. Woke up in the middle of the night with bites all over my legs, arms, and back. We flip a pillow over and there it was. BED BUGS. We had to cut our trip short. The man at the front desk apologized and gave us the managers name and number and told us to call back later that morning. We have been calling since 8/10 and have yet to receive a call back. Such disrespect. We risk bringing back bed bugs and spending hundreds on extermination fees and no has the decency to call back."
"What a dump! I booked this room for one night for a place to stay after a Pirates game. It's dirty and weird. Our room is big but it's fills with furniture salvaged for garage sales. The free breakfast is as bad as it gets. (Old cereal and bread.) The bed was hard and here is the best part. A rhythmic thumb, thumb, thumb woke me up at 7:30. The whole room shook. I'll called the front desk and they said it was somebody running in the exercise room. This when on for exactly 45 minute. (Impressive cardiovascular stamina)What else...the pool is in a green house, everything is dirty, there is a weird quartet sitting in the lobby at 1:00 AM just talking...?"
"I've stayed at Day's Inn hotels before, so this was my first rather unpleasant experience with them. I arrived late at night & when I checked into my room, the hot air was blasting. I lowered the temp, but it took about 30 minutes for the heating/cooling unit to make the temp adjustment. In the meantime, I returned to my car to retrieve the rest of my luggage. When I returned, the room was cooler, and now I was able to smell the most powerfully moldy smell I've ever experienced in a hotel ever. I was completely exhausted from the long drive and just passed out. In the morning, I woke up with a horribly scratchy sore throat and swollen lymph nodes. Plus the ""non-smoking"" room had obviously had smokers and pets there previously. I moved to another room the following morning, which was much better, but the overall feel of the hotel was rather low class & skanky."
"We stayed here while on business. I wish we had booked somewhere else. The staff here is incredibly rude, lazy and completely incapable of caring about customer service."
"The rooms are filthy with mold. There is so much mold congealed near the A/C units and around the perimeter of the rooms. We got 3 rooms and all had the same issues. The front desk hostess was nice, and helpful. The cleaning staff i presume doesn't exist. Stay here for an inexpensive night close to downtown but don't stay here for more than that, especially if you're not concerned with monies."
Never go here the fire extinguisher glass is broken and does not appear to be clean up someone could cut themselves two outlets in my room did not work the breakfast is just cereal if you want toast don't bother the toaster is broken
"From reading other reviews and dining guides, it looks like this is very much a hit or miss place. Either you love pizza with toppings thrown on after cooking, or you don't. I fall into the later category: I didn't like it at all.I ordered a slice of cheese pizza and a grilled chicken salad. For the pizza, the crust was salvageable after I pushed aside a good quantity of cheese (most of it). The salad was...nothing short of horrific. Overloaded with fries and (big surprise) more cheese, getting to the lettuce and other toppings took some digging. Eventually, I found bland tomatoes and shredded iceberg lettuce hidden far below.I don't get this place."
This was just bad pizza.  For the money I expect that the toppings will be cooked on the pizza.  The cheese and pepparoni were added after the crust came out.  Also the mushrooms were out of a can.  Do not waste money here.
"This ""pizza"" was the worst food I have ever eaten."
No way. A ton of cold shredded cheese thrown on top of pizza? No no no. No beer either.
"I knew the original owner of Beto's and she would be furious for what is being done to it, now.  If the pizza slice gets any smaller, you'll have to call it a breadstick.  There was almost NO meat, on my Italian hoagie, which used to be the best around.  Whoever recently took over, should be ASHAMED.  Betos now STINKS."
Worse than store freezer pizza. What with the cold cheese on top of hot pizza? Terrible. If you want quality; Fiori's is a few miles away.
"Ok, so the gimmick is cold cheese and toppings on freshly cooked dough and sauce. It doesn't work.I get the same effect from a microwave pizza that wasn't in long enough. Also, if you are going to serve your food this way (unfinished), at least have the decency to use quality ingredients. I'm quite certain the pepperoni was of the Hormel variety. I don't understand why you would spend your money on a low quality, unfinished pizza when there are SO many better options in the area.However, based on the amount of business they were doing you may want to give it a try. I for one will not be returning..."
"We are from out of town and heard this place had good pizza. I decided to call and order a pizza, so asked about what kind of sizes, type of crust and if they do white pizza. The guy told me he only had pizza crust and red sauce and since I was asking for a different type of pizza, that this wasn't the right pizza place for me. He told me I wouldn't want to order from them and hung up the phone. Not sure if it was because if my Hispanic accent or what but he was extremely rude and didn't even give me a chance to order or ask. I would have been perfectly fine with a red sauce, regular pizza crust with cheese and pepperoni but he wouldn't even take my order. I was just trying to ask. Rude. Very!"
"If I could rate it zero stars I would. Their pizza is nothing more than a glorified ""Lunchable"".That was my son's description, and it was spot on. I can't understand how this place stays in business. I have eaten pizza in Italy, so I know good pizza, and this is not even pizza!!! It's a thick cracker like dough with canned sauce (tastes like that) and COLD cheese covering everything. JUST AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"I disliked the cold cheese and cold pepperoni on so so crust. Obviously many people like it.  I went out of my way to go there, and had heard of the cold cheese gimmick. Not my cup of tea...just a heads up if you go there to compare to other pizzerias.  Not comparable to the other top ten pizza joints in Pittsburgh."
"Gotta say this place is HUGELY overrated.  Girls working there were just plain rude and in need of a serious attitude adjustment. You work at a pizza restaurant, you're gonna be busy on a Saturday night, get over it or find another job. I did it myself when I worked at a pizza shop years ago. The pizza itself is ok at best.  There's absolutely no organization in the dining area, pretty much a free for all for a table. Even if they had 1 person to clean tables and seat people, would make it much better to eat in. And to me, it seems like there were more than enough people to accomplish that during the busiest hours. A few  minor changes would have me coming back, and I'm guessing many others. Or they just don't care because they're gonna b busy either way."
Very disappointed with this dry cleaner. Had a small hole in a set of pants by a belt buckle. Came back with hand stitches that were messy and very noticeable. Definitely not worth the expensive prices.
"I've never, EVER experienced such poor customer service before at any beer distributor.  Yes, I called them and asked for a price on ordering a case of import beer.  When they called me back with the price, I decilned purchase.  I was talking at the same time to another distributor who was doing a lot more leg work for me tracking down the supply chain.  When he informed me he could have a case shipped to wherever I bought my beer, I gave him Banksville Beer's name thinking I was giving them some extra business.  I don't normally get my beer from there.  When I stopped into Banksville to pick it up, a person who I assume was the owner got immediately defensive with me, raised his voice saying ""You told me you didn't want it.""  I tried to explain what had happened, but he continuously interupted me with a constantly rising voice level barely allowing me to get a word in.  He claimed he did not speak to the guy I had spoken to, which was obviously a lie since he referred specifically to ""that person you (meaning me) talked to.""  I finally had to cut him off and say, ""Listen, do you have the case here or not?""  He said they did not, so I left.I can understand his frustration if what I did caused him any loss or inconveneince, but he did not need to take the majorly unprofessional approach that he did.  I honestly had no idea that I did anything wrong, and on the contrary thought I had actually done them a favor.  Had he explained the circumstance, it would have been no harm, no foul and lesson learned.  And I just would have asked them to order me a case straight out and would have returned for more cases to be orderd in the future.  But because of that reaction, I will NEVER step foot in there again under any circumstance.  No beer is worth dealing with a world class A-hole like that."
"Awful. One of the worst bars I have ever been in. The smell of this place will make you gag. Never cleaned, floor is sticky YUCK! STAY AWAY!"
Small dark not very opening or friendly place. Will not be returning. The floor is dirty. The bathrooms are small tgey stink and the lock is broken on the womans side. No food offered. Maybe u have to ask. I got a vodka cran and it was watered down. The only good thing was free parking out back.
Mediocre and poorly made! You can get better quality food from Mcdonalds don't waste your time or money
"I would give this eat n park location zero stars if I could. I arrived at 11:15am and was seated quickly but that was about it. My waitress did not come over until 11:41. I did not receive water or any service for 26 minutes.  That is outrageous to me, I've never had anything good to say about this location and will not be visiting again."
"My experience here was not good my family and I were seated all the way in the back of the Resturant near an exit after passing at least six tables upfront. We were the ONLY African Americans in the restaurants not even one as a busboy we had some stares but no one was rude just very quiet . The waitress tried to make us feel welcome so we thank her for that but the feeling was uneasy and on top of all that, the food wasn't good it lacked lots of flavor I wouldn't recommend this spot to anyone keep driving"
"Don't waste your time. Incorrect orders are the norm. It's fairly disgusting (sticky tables, trash everywhere). The last time we stopped in there were seven people working...but maybe actually three doing work. The other four were checking their cellphones or standing around talking. There is one young girl there who works her ass off but the rest contribute to the chaos."
"This store will not let you photograph their lighting fixtures. We browsed for a while and found a chandelier we liked, and my husband took a picture of it on his cell phone. The salesclerk told us that was not allowed. We were dumbfounded. We are renovating a house and need a number of light fixtures, plumbing fixtures, etc.-- the only way we can keep track of them all (and check if they actually might look good together) is to photograph everything we're seriously considering. We tried to explain this and the clerk said nope, not allowed. We asked why. She said, ""I don't know-- they just don't allow it."" Well I bet I know-- they don't want you going online in search of better pricing. But hey, NEWSFLASH-- that's how things work in 2012. I'm not going to drop $1,200 on a chandelier without looking it up online. (For the record, I understand that local businesses aren't usually going to have the lowest price available. I don't mind paying a bit of a premium to support a small business in Pittsburgh that gave me great in-person service. But like hell am I going to spend that kind of money without making sure I'm not getting completely ripped off.)We tried to press further, though-- what about matching finishes or colors to other fixtures? The salesclerk said, ""Oh, people just tell us what colors they have in their room and how big the room is and we tell them what works."" I'm sorry, but unless you're omniscient, this is not acceptable. The most insulting thing, though, is the clerk telling us ""I don't know"" about a policy that's so clearly the exception to the local norm. If you're going to have a ridiculous, anachronistic rule, at least have the guts to explain why to customers when they ask."
"If I could give this place less than one star I would. I recently bought a lamp here which yes, is very pretty.. But the customer service is by far the worst I have ever experienced. I should have known not to buy a lamp here as the one saleswoman was extremely pushy and followed me all around the store the entire time and kept trying to sell me a $400 lamp. As soon as I got home I was unwrapping the lamp shade and noticed that it was cracked. I called immediately and explained that I had received a flawed product. They assured me they would order a new shade and it would come in within 7 days and they would call to let me know when it came in. Needless to say it's been two weeks now and no one has called me about it. I have now called 4 times and every person I've spoken to tries to shuttle me off the phone immediately without explanation. The last conversation I had was with a woman who worked there who told me ""she was just a worker and couldn't help me with what I wanted"". I bought a lamp from there for a few hundred dollars, they sent me home with a broken lamp, they told me they would call and they still haven't and now they act like they have no idea who I am, and the employee tells me she can't help me? I would never give these people my money again. You can find equally nice things at a different store for a better price with people that actually respect you."
"The stuff that this store has are definitely nice (the majority of them).  However, when you buy a lamb that will cost at least a couple of hundreds you expect to get also an equally impressive service. This is by far not true in this store.  The service is rather incompetent.  Not only they try to oversell to you but they also do not respect their customers.  Actually, while we walked into the store, I was surprised to hear one of the ladies working there asking another customer to pay upfront before doing the required changes to the lamb they had asked for (as if the customer would leave without getting the lamb he went there for).  I thought this was weird but I ignored it; maybe I should have gotten the single and left the store.  In my case, while we bought a lamp the lady asked us whether we wanted one of their ""super-duper"" light bulbs that will last forever.  We said no it is fine, since we literally have about 50 light bulbs at home.  To our surprise when we went home we found that there was a light bulb in the box they gave us, which was also apparently charged ($20).  On top of that, when we tried to use this super light bulb it was not a surprise that it was not functioning at all!  Definitely I will not be going back to this place."
"The owners were all smiles when I plunked down $1,000 for merchandise and services. But, when I pointed out minor defects in the merchandise and major problems in rewiring an antique lamp, they couldn't be bothered. I have never been treated with such disrespect. I don't know how they manage to stay in business. Beware."
"Some of the food and drink items are overpriced.  After waiting forever to get served, my food turned out to be horrible and was sent back..this entire visit was a disappointment.  No reason to ever go back."
"This place is another that is undeserving of your hard earned money!! The following is an email that I sent to the owner, it will shed a little light as to why I feel this way...I will also share his response, and what ultimately became of the situation. I know this one is long winded, but you should be forewarned about giving them your money!I have been to your bar many times, and I have had both good and less than average experiences, but this past Saturday was terrible! My girlfriend and I came to have some dinner around 9 pm. We knew it would be crowded due to the Penguin game, and that wasn't a problem. When we arrived, there were no seats at the bar or tables available anywhere. We decided to have a beer and wait. After the game was over, some tables opened up so we sat in an empty booth in the back and waited. After about 5 minutes, a waitress came over, cleaned our table, and made notice of the fact that we still had drinks. Sadly, this was the last time that she ever came to our table. We placed our closed menus at the end of the table...nothing, we put our empty glasses at the end of the table with the menus...nothing. We sat and waited for more than 15 minutes. All the while we were waiting, another group of four sat the table next to us, they were never given any attention. They got up and left after being completely ignored. I understand that the restaurant was busy, and that service and wait times may be impacted, but the way we were treated (or lack of being treated) was appalling. It was especially annoying to watch the server that initially cleaned our table giggling and carrying on with two other booths that appeared to be friends with her on the other side of the dining room and then when she was done she just casually walked over to another empty table picked up something off of it and went into the kitchen without even taking a look around the dining room. At this point we were disgusted and got up and left, I was annoyed and made mention of how awful the service in the back was to the doorman. The waitresses in the back were terrible and seemed to have no sense of urgency or seem to care about most of the customers, with the exception of the few tables that they were more interested in socializing with. This seems to be a problem, because on some of my past less than stellar experiences, the disappointment was again with the service from the back servers. On those occasions it was the same thing, they seemed to be more interested in being social butterflies than providing any sort of service. You don't need to improve your wait staff, you need to replace some of them, at least the people working the back dining room on this past Saturday, they were completely useless! Will I come back to your restaurant, I'm not sure. The food is good, but I work hard for my money, and I expect to receive more than good food in exchange for it. Sincerely, Matt K.Here is the response that I gotPlease give me a call (412)555-1212 to discuss the matter. I'm sorry & will make every attempt to make sure this doesn't happen again.Thank you for making me aware of the situation.Joey DeMarco I promptly called him as soon as I got this email. It went to voice mail , so I left a message. That was it, the guy didn't even have the decency to return my phone call. It is amazing that this is how business owners expect to keep people coming through their doors and handing over their hard earned money. Support local businesses, but make sure they are deserving of your money!"
"HORRIBLE ALL AROUND!!!!! Came in on a Sunday morning for breakfast around 1045, walked in and the girl said it would be a ten minute wait. We sat at the bar to wait so she forgot about us. After about 25 minutes or so we asked how long and she took us to the booth that was open for about 23 minutes. Went to the table, sat there for about another 20 minutes with our menus folded at the end of the table. After we had a table sit down next to is and get service right away we asked why nobody has come over. The waitress was confused and didn't know why. Waitress didn't write down our order and had to come back and ask what we got. Food was ehhh.....FINALLY left around 1230, so it took almost 2 hours to have a horrible experience."
"I ordered a burger and sweet potato fries, my burger was pink on the inside..not how I like to eat them.  Our waitress was initially very helpful and took it back to the kitchen to have them cook it longer for me.25 minutes later my date had finished his meal and my fries were gone.  Our waitress never returned to let me know what was going on, when she did I ended up asking her to just box my burger up for me to go thinking I would eat it for lunch the next day.  When I re-heated the supposedly re-cooked burger the following day it was still pink on the inside.  So I am not sure what the kitchen had been doing for 25 minutes but it was not cooking my burger.We will not be returning here!"
"From the moment we walked in I knew we were in for in for an interesting experience. Instead of being greeted with a smiling, friendly ""Hi, welcome to cains"" we were greeted with a frantically working, unhelpful, stressed out hostess who had no clue how to deal with the influx of people. We were there during a breakfast rush. When we walked in the hostess told us that it would be 45 minutes for the kitchen to prepare our food. Since we had known cains for their delicious breakfast, we thought the wait would be worth it. But an hour and fifteen minutes later we get our food. My Breakfast burrito tasted like nothing and a our food was cold. The only good thing about the experience was the warm donuts. Poor service, crappy food. Overall not the way a restaurant should be run."
"I would give this place half a star if I could. The service was the most appalling I have ever experienced. We ordered sandwiches and fries and waited a FULL HOUR for our food. After 30 minutes of waiting we had to glad down our waitress to find out how much longer, she laughed it off and said there were three tickets in front of us still. Our veggie burgers and fries came out cold but by that point we wear starved and not about to send our precious food back to that black hole of a kitchen, where apparently time doesn't exist. The waitress gave us our check, stated that the manager would not do anything for us for the long wait and she ""did what she could"" and discounted $5 from our $55 bill. HA! We requested to speak with the manager who avoided us for 10 minutes before she came over and made excuses about it being busy and other people ordering specialty items. She continued to make excuses and said the best she would do is discount 10%. What a joke. I would never go back here if someone paid me."
"Do not order steak or prime rib here.  The prime rib, ordered rare, was medium, dry and extremely salty.  The rib eye was thinly cut, salty and dry.  When I told the waitress, she said the chef said it should not have been and maybe I did something to it, like it was my fault.  I felt insulted.  The bill was $38.00 so it is pricey.  I was very disappointed and would not order anything but wings here."
"Hi there...went with a group of five for brunch today and things started off well. Coffee...water...good fun. Then we ordered...three of our party received their orders within 15 minutes and liked their food. The fourth got his about 30 minutes later and his food was terrible. Cold. Greasy. Stale. The fifth, me, never received the short stack of pancakes and eggs I ordered. Bad service by the wait staff and manager...they checked in with me and left to figure out where my order went several times. Then they'd come back and ask what's wrong as if they forgot they were already tasked to find my order. Cain's is usually a good place but this morning they dropped the ball...and apparently my pancakes and eggs."
"Came for breakfast. Kim the ""manager"" was mean from the time we walked in the door. We tried to sit at a table but she told us they had a big party coming. Then, she sat 2 small parties there. 90 minutes later, after those people had gotten food and eaten, we asked about our breakfast. We were then told it would be ANOTHER 15 minutes. Funny thing is, my friend had told me how horrible the service is and how mean the chick at the front acts. We tried to give them the benefit of the doubt. Bad idea. This place is a bad idea all around.One star that belongs to the bald bartender."
"Very disappointed in this place. The food was pretty good, I'll give them that....but the owner was inappropriate to say the least. He wouldn't leave my female friend alone and got extremely inappropriate with her to the point we were forced to leave bc she was uncomfortable with his never-ending inappropriateness. We are never going back."
"I really wish I could give this shit hole a zero but I have to give something. First we get in at 7 pm and after where seated we wait a good 15 mins for our waiter to show up to take our beer orders. Another 15 mins later and still no beer, another 5 mins we finally get the beer and of course everyone's beer is flat. Another god damn 15 mins later still no beer or waitress to take our food order. Finally after about an hour we get set with our beers and food, our damn food is ice cold. At this point I'm fed up along with everyone else and we call over the manager. This little dick head comes over and starts yelling at the four of us saying we either have a choice to eat or get out. We were more than happy to get the hell out of there with the shitest service and cold ass food ever. The long and short of it is that if you want to have a even good or a sorta good experience at diner without being told by a manager that I should stop talking, do not ever go to this place. Never ever go to this place if you even want to have a meal, or a hot meal if I should say, because this place will bend you over, grab the broom by the handle and sweep your ass out the door with it. I've never had someone esp a manager tell me to eat or get out. That's all I have to say."
"I really can't believe this place is still open due to the service and the food. I came here with 3 other people and all of us felt disrespected, ignored and abused. At one point I had to call the manager and he flat out told me to shut up at one point. I'm an adult, not a child, and wtf is he thinking that he told me to shut up he's lucky I didn't flip the table then and there. Believe me if you ever want to be treated like an adult and have a nice meal avoid this place like the plague. This place is a cancerous sore in dormont, and with cancer you get rid of it. This place should be torn down and turned into something nice that supports people and doesn't leave a sour taste when you leave. This place is sad."
We have been there twice in the last month and both times the orders were brought out wrong and this past time there were items missing and instead of taking responsibility for messing up the order the waitress blamed it on the kitchen. When the missing items were brought out they were cold and inedible.
"Ordered salmon. Fishy smell. Not fresh at all. Had to talk myself into eating it. Hostess not friendly. She asked me what I wanted, made me feel like maybe I should walk out. Should of went with it. Overall dissapointing meal. Good placement of TVs is about it"
"Great beer list and service is awesome! No more monday all you can eat crab legs....Not coolAnd how do you not have ribs or chicken when it's two of your main things?!!!!!Supposed to be known for your bbq and you don't have it!!!!!Alright..... Coming back to add to this....This place is empty.... And for a reason. My family and I got 4 dinners.. 1 salad, a burger which was way over done and dry. and 2 bbq dishes. The brisket and pork.. Only two meats they had. And everything was cold. Not hot at all.... Server Kim was awesome. So apologetic and we know it wasn't her fault. Manager was awesome and wasn't her fault either and they did comp our whole check.But kitchen has a lot of problems. I hope they work through them bc it is a nice place."
"They got the date of my wedding day wrong after we discussed the day and date for months. I called to see where my flowers were after they were suppose to arrive and they told me they got the date of my wedding wrong and thought it was the next day. My bouquet didn't have bloomed flowers, my flower girls bouquet fell apart as soon as we put it on her wrist, and the flowers arrived 2 hours late not to mention the stress that was put on me the bride on my wedding date with the fear of not have flowers."
"I came home one night to find unpackaged flowers sitting at my door. Normally, I would be excited, however, this was not the case. My information card was poking out of the flowers in the open, revealing my full name, address, and phone number. Being a young woman living in a new city, I was upset to see the carelessness by Dormont regarding my privacy. They did not care at all that they left my personal information out in the open for anyone passing to take. When I called to complain, the woman apologized and said that this has never been brought up as a concern before. Even though it has never been a concern before, it should immediately become one for you when a customer is calling to complain, especially when I said it made me feel unsafe. This is the last time I will ever want to see Dormont Florist anywhere near me. I am the type to always enjoy fresh flowers in her home and will be finding a new florist with higher standards."
"For what it's worth, dor-stop isn't good as people say it was. People are fanatical about this place and its food. Is their food really tasty or they're popular because the network show? From my perspective, I detest their service, the service is notoriously horrible and unacceptable. Also the food was unpalatable. I order pumpkin flavor pancakes and side order scramble eggs. I was too full and their portion is huge so I left two pieces of pancakes. The waitress don't even bother to ask me if I need a box to take it home or if everything is good. Although she did refilled my coffee once, I barely see her stop by and there wasn't too many people in the diner is isn't likely she is occupied by that amount of customers.I think the waitress was rude because she never say thank you during the entire breakfast even when I tipped her. I should have known, I just feel like they treated me differently that's all. This review is based on my dinning experience and the service. Seriously if they mean business they should improve. Especially waitress was lack of enthusiasm. Do I want to come back? Never ever."
"I really, really wanted to try Dor - Stop, but it wasn't open when I went! My wife and I woke up early just to go there, and the diner was closed for the next few days, EVEN THOUGH IT DIDNT SAY THAT ON THE WEBSITE! Such a waste of time. If you're going to go, make sure you call ahead, just so you don't get screwed over like we did."
"Pancakes, pancakes, pancakes.  Everybody told me I HAD to try and their pancakes.Well, the short stack they served me were lousy pancakes."
DorStop is my favorite breakfast spot but on this visit I was extremely disappointed.  I stopped in on a whim alone and sat at the counter.  While I was eating my delicious breakfast a dishwasher stood in front of me and spit  in the garbage can on the other side of the counter literally a foot away from me.  I immediately wanted to throw up.  I did not finish my meal and got up and paid and left.  They were too busy too mention something and they never asked how everything was or I would have said something.  I am not sure if I will go back which is really a shame.  I love that place.
Aside from the quaint brown paper on cardboard packaging I just can't get into bland sauce on cardboard equivalent crust. I've had better factory pizza at $6 for a large around the block.
"I'm wondering what was worse: the service or the product.  If you are going to have a bad attitude, there should at least be a good product waiting for the customer on the other end.  If you offer a sub-par product, at least be nice.  These guys offer the worst of both worlds.  Don't bother."
New ownership is a joke.  Has manager fire a 40 year employee over the phone.  No balls to handle the situation himself or in person. Nice way to operate a business.  Idiot
Quality has taken a nosedive since changing hands.  Nothing is as good as it was.  Now it's just crap.
"You know it's bad when you get in your car practically in tears because of how bad the haircut is. Having curly hair, I've had my fair share of terrible haircuts. The one I had at this salon was among the worst. I explained to the owner of the salon how I wanted my layering, but apparently because I didn't tell him exactly how to cut my hair - since after all, I figured he's the one who should know how to cut hair, including curly hair - it's my fault that I received such a terrible haircut. Sorry, I guess I was too busy watching in horror as he blunt cut horizontal layers into my hair (exactly the opposite of what you're supposed to do with curly hair). The owner clearly has no idea how to cut curly hair. And he's overpriced to boot. The other stylists may give better cuts, but the owner's attitude (""It's not my fault"") suggests this salon deserves no one's business."
"Short of getting on my hands and knees and begging the stylist to cut ONE HALF of an INCH, I don't know what else I could have done.. Before every haircut I explain that I am very particular about the length of my hair -- I want to keep it long, it grows very slowly, that it is IMPERATIVE to only cut a TINY AMOUNT off, etc, etc. I made this extremely clear to the stylist. She promised that she ""wouldn't do anything crazy..""Let's just say I am using this as a cathartic outlet for my experience because I went in for a trim but left with FOUR INCHES missing from my hair. I'm still recovering aesthetically and emotionally from this trauma! It just doesn't make sense to me why a stylist would do exactly the opposite of what was requested. I think maybe she is used to cutting children's hair and not listening to them. But either way, what should have been a really quick/easy trim, turned into one of the most extreme haircuts of my life. It all could have been so easily avoided. It doesn't feel fair. Proceed with caution.."
"My daughter has been going to Geno Como for about a year now, her stylist was Danielle Emmons. She called to make an appointment for herself and me ( Mother's Day gift ) unfortunately she was told Danielle no longer works there. Gave us appointments with owner Geno for Saturday 5/16/15 2pm and 3pm. We arrived at 2pm my daughter was first. She showed Geno the length she wanted, he cut it shorter than she wanted and you couldn't tell that it was chopped up all different length since he dried it blowing curls in. He asked her if she liked it, she told him she didn't like how he styled it and that she would fix it when you got home. My turn, I should have went with gut feeling RUN but I didn cause this was part of my Mother's Day gift. I told Geno I donate my hair to locks of love and showed him how much to cut off. I've been donating my hair for years and I know how much to cut. Geno told me I should donate my hair to Pantene and preceded to tell me why he likes them better than locks of love. Told Geno thanks for your input but I donate to locks of love. He put my hair in a ponytail got out his electric trimmer and preceded to cut off my hair. All the salons that have cut off my hair used scissors. Weird !  He cut way more than I showed him the back is so short the front is longer and the hole cut is choppy all different lengths. I don't know what to do with this other than wear a hat for a few week. Thank God my hair grows fast. This man clearly should retire. I wish my daughter would have read the reviews before we went there and she would have seen Geno can't cut curly hair. We got there at 2pm and Geno took my daughter right away, we weren't finish till 5:30pm that 3 1/2 hours to destroy two heads of hair. One reviewer said he takes his time I don't think that the case he looked a little confused at time. Over priced $60.00 each for Geno when my daughter had Danielle she paid $35.00 but they don't tell you Geno prices. NOT NiCE !  Save your money don't go there and if you do you will be wearing a hat just like me."
"My mistake that I went to Namaste India with my cousin. Pappad were served in the beginning and that was the only moment we could afford a smile! Rest was a complete disaster..We ordered aloo tikki and ""much recommended"" samosa Chaat!!  Samosa chaat was cold to touch- looked like a heap of poorly cooked samosa.. worse was the RED CHILLI powder used as garnishing ( we asked it to be a bit spicy- our fault) ..that too in plenty... we could have used that amount of red chiili powder for cooking food for some 6-7 people!! Taste was below average...we could barely think of ordering main course after the initial encounter.. Malai kofta is what we ordered besides daal... Malai Kofta looked like stuffed with samosa!! ( Pun intended) ... bland and tasteless.. NAAN were good ..thin , baked properly...out only consolation... No wonder we left half of the  ordered dishes...Worth mentioning is the fact that..Kohli's store is adjacent and we saw some samosas there..I wonder if the ones we had at namaste were part of the same deal? Please beware of this place- you may end up cursing yourself for your visit later on... as we are doing right now..."
"This was probably one of the worst places I've eaten at in a while . I'm not sure what was worse food or service . Never again , the coupon we bought and weren't allowed to use left on the table"
"I have dined at Namaste for the final time.  I am tired of being served by an individual that does not speak: who treats the customer with disdain and indifference.  The words ""thank you"" and ""how are you"" are not part of the lexicon here.  The buffet items reflect economizing.  Virtually no cauliflower is used, thus my favorite dish, aloo gobi, is never offered..  There sometimes is no rice pudding, and in place of the India staple buffet item, chicken tandoori, the cheaper and less appealing chicken wings are offered.  It is s shame that such a beautiufl, comfortable restaurant space is being wasted.  For a mere $1.01 more, I can receive a spectacular and delicious array of the finest Indian food in the lovely atmosphere of All India, North Craig Street, Oakland, where I receive gracious, personal attention from the owners."
"I wish I could give this place ""-5"" stars for its terrible food quality. Oily, greasy and bad taste. All 4 members of our party fell sick, throwing up and/or with a running stomach."
"Shockingly bad.  I know it's Pittsburg so my expectations were low, but there is no call for rudeness.  The old lady should retire.  The young waiter was ok but clearly  scared of the woman.   I went to the dinner buffet at 530 pm, the food was obviously left over from lunch, the rice was so old it was crunchy, all other food was very low quality and mostly cold. I always like to say something nice so the sweet carrot dish was not horrible.  My search for quality Indian food in the 'burgh continues."
I wish I could give them 0 stars...total waste of money. Food was so bad that I threw it in the trash. Hope no one falls sick after eating food here.
"Maharaja is located in the Days Inn on Banksville Rd, and we tried it one day for lunch. Not really understanding the positive reviews here, but to each his/her own. I found the food watery, overcooked (even by Indian food standards) and tasteless. There seemed to be no care in preparation of the dishes, so that the vegetables weren't cut into the same sizes, each dish tasted much like the other, and the food didn't even look attractive. I don't mind divey surroundings, but I abhor a smelly old carpet, and they have wall to wall carpeting that was around before most of us were. They offer mango lassi which they keep in the original gallon plastic jug that they bought it in...at least pretend that you made it. There are 2 better Indian restaurants a stones throw from this place...Namaste and Mintt, both across the street."
Terrible place to eat and not very clean at all. Way over priced foe fast food. 5$ for a plain roast beef forget that!
"I actually don't mind the Arby's chain; I certainly don't go to one on a regular basis, but when I do I usually enjoy the treat that is a so-not-good-for-me fast food type of sandwich and a side of curly fries. Usually what I get from an Arby's is an a-ok fast food variety sandwich that, while greasy, is still very tasty and doesn't leave me feeling sick to my stomach.That said, I never truly enjoy the food I pick up from this particular Arby's. Firstly, often when I've placed an order in their drive-thru I've found that I've had to sit and wait for my ""fast food"" for 10 to 15 minutes. After waiting for my food - on the days that I didn't leave the line in frustration before placing an order at all because I couldn't even do so in a reasonable amount of time - I've found that what I've gotten has been mediocre compared to what I've experienced at other Arby's. Common issues I've come across include the lack of sauces when I've asked for them, overcooked food, and so much grease that the sandwich begins coming apart, AND after eating I begin to feel sick to my stomach. Sorry, guys. I may not expect a lot from a fast food joint, but this Arby's just doesn't impress me."
Well....I'm sitting here and the lady running the front is screaming at everyone in the back. It is stressful to listen to. Not an enjoyable experience. She needs to calm down.
"Sadly really went downhill. They switched to a new vendor, the prices went up and they are no longer having sales."
"Consumer Beware !!!!This place is a joke! We had a party of thirty and had heard good things about this establishment.  The food is average at best (Same pizza as Cici's pizza as far as taste) We payed a little shy of 1000.00$ for two and a half large pizzas, a small pan of overcooked wings,  Two loaves of bread with some balogna and ham they called a hoagie, and a small salad. Thank goodness they had beer and wine(at an extra cost) for us to drink and two televisions to watch the football game on(But wouldnt turn any sound on)  . They told us it was an all you can eat buffet for our guest (most were over 60) but when the wings and salad were gone they would replinish it only for ""An extra phenominal fee"" . The people who wanted to enjoy a cup of coffee were also told so sorry,, That will also be an ""Additional Cost""!!The money isnt an issue if they would have been up front and honest with us. We all had a TERRIBLE experience here and unfortunately will NEVER step foot in this place again.And to top things off,,  The pizza and two so called hoagies that were left over(because they were all bread) and we payed for, We were told we could not take home because someone might get sick. Im sorry, But I didnt pay to feed your staff dinner !!!!! On a good note, The bartender was a great guy and very good at his job."
"one of the worst steak sandwiches i've ever eaten. there were 7 of us and the only people who liked their food were the kids and the one who had the pizza. i would never eat here again"
"I am not being hyperbolic when I say that my last experience here was the worst food experience I have ever had. I have eaten at Bado's before and have had pizza that was pretty tasty. So when my roomate wanted to go there, I was pretty excited. There were 4 of us. Two of us had burgers while the other two ordered wedding soup and shared potato skins. My burger was delicious. It was juicy and smothered in bleu cheese. While my food was really good, there were some issues with the other items ordered. Two of my guests cited that the wedding soup had a metalic taste to it while my other friend with the burger found a hair. Being a hairdresser and understanding that it does happen sometimes, she disregarded it and continued to eat her burger. Unfortunately, the hair did not stop there. Another guest found several hairs in their meal as well. We decided that we should let our waitress know. I stopped the waitress and explained how there was hair in two people's food. The waitress got upset and was very rude (it's not like we accused her of planting the hair herself). On top of this, she mistakenly took my burger and walked away with it, leaving the sullied food on the table. When she came back I told her that my burger was not one of the items with food on it and she instantly became defensive. At this point we asked for a manager (who never came) and insisted our meal get comped. Considering she threw out the only good food that we ordered, we didn't feel like that was asking too much. Luckily the waitress did not put up too much of a fight. I will never eat at Bado's again. A good cheese burger and a decent pie isn't enough when the staff can't even accept their own (human) mistakes. I have been places where there have been food issues before and I have also worked in a restaurant. I completely understand that mistakes happen. However, the reaction that we received was unacceptable."
"I will never go back. Besides the gnocchi coming from a vacuum sealed bag, they offer a "" Pittsburgh Sandwich "" they don't know how to make. Served fries on the side and bagged coleslaw. Fries were an afterthought due to the pickle found underneath.  watched a young waiter spill two drinks, or e on a customer.  Same waiter after avoiding a table with cash payment, waiting for them to leave so he could pocket the change, finally got them change, as soon as they left he pulled out his wallet and put the tip inside.So unprofessional. Food from a box and under trained staff. Not if they begged would I go back."
"Very disappointed in our delivery order this evening. The potato soup was runny, and looked like milky water with a few potatoes in it. The wedding soup was less than fair. Thee Buffalo chicken sandwich had no lettuce or tomato on it. The Reuben and fries were soggy and greasy. The chicken salad, the lettuce was wilted, although the chicken strips were the best thing in the whole order. The turkey grilled sandwich also had no lettuce or tomato and was greasy and soggy and did not come with the chips and pickles as listed on the menu. For what they charged for this. It was a disgrace . We will not order again and will pass the word around. There are too many other  decent and less expensive delivery restaurants to ever order from there again. Disappointed."
Had the gnocchi delivered. Absolutely terrible. Gnocci's had to have been 2 years old. Delivery guy was shady too.
I don't like this place at all. The staff here is always rude and has no sense of care at all for their business. A couple years ago I had heard they smoke over making their pizza. All of their employees tend to be shady. I don't recommend at all.
"Absolutely horrible. I used to eat here 20 years ago when I was in high school and i thought i liked it. From the moment the jerk answered the phone until the gross food was delivered by the rudest delivery driver i've ever come across, it was a horrible experience."
I used to live in the area and would always patronize and recommend this business.  However with the last experience I will have to rethink that. My aunt and uncle ordered a gift basket for my grandmother for her birthday. When it was delivered it looked beautiful.  However once opened not so much.  Inside it was filled with....Dollar General brand goods. When I stopped down to tell them the owner and another worker told me what do you expect. If it was a busy season we would have gotten stuff from the strip. So moral of the tale. If you want to pay a whole lot of money for stuff from the Dollar Store you know where to go. To make it even more special the owner will provide a blank stare and a warm welcoming attitude that clearly shows she does not care.
"I wish there were negative stars I could put for this place.  One of the most unprofessional experiences I have ever had with a business owner, not even a worker.  I was yelled at, mocked, and generally treated like crap for checking up on a remounting job that was supposed to be done within a week.  Emotional mess the rest of the day.  I have never been treated that way with any owner of a business.   I work with restaurant owners for god's sake!   Unbelievable.   If you want the full story, email me and I will tell you the whole thing.  As it is right now, DO NOT patronize this business.   There was absolutely no excuse for his attitude."
"So incredibly disappointed with the 'service' I received at Blooming Dahlia last month!! I actually felt sick to my stomach after leaving the store because the florist (who I believe was the owner) was so nasty... basically kicking me out, waving goodbye with one hand (as if quaking like a duck!) and rudely blurting out ""bye, bye"" in a mean tone!... and in front of my 17 year old daughter who was actually shocked by the florist's behavior. Are you kidding me?!?! I had pre-ordered a presentation bouquet a few days prior for my 12 year old who was performing the lead role in the Nutcracker that Sunday... one dozen esperanza roses at $4 each. I went to Blooming Dahlia because I wanted something extra special for the bouquet that would be presented to her onstage during the bows.  Though the bouquet was not ready when my older daughter and I stopped by the store in between Saturday performances, I did not complain. When I noticed the florist wrapping the roses in light brown tissue paper (that actually looked like a brown paper bag), I asked if they had any pink or white tissue paper that they could use instead. The florist was visibly annoyed by my request but did look to see if she had any other colors (which they did not). Okay, I thought, I can simply rewrap the roses with pretty tissue paper when I get home. But, when she started ringing up my order at $5 per rose (versus her original quote of $4 each), I decided not to purchase the bouquet. Why would I pay such a high price for roses that were nice but certainly not extra special and that I would have to go home unwrap and rewrap in my own tissue paper?! I actually apologized to her and said thank you, but I have decided not to purchase the bouquet (which, by the way, was still not completely arranged and wrapped). She looked at me and asked, ""so you are not taking the bouquet?"" and I replied, ""no, I'm sorry. It's not what I was looking for, but thank you"". And that's when she rudely waved me and my daughter out of the shop. Needless to say, I will NOT be returning to the Blooming Dahlia... and I will NOT hesitate to share my unfortunate experience with others. There are plenty of other good florists in the South Hills..."
"Absolutely wretched and incompetent billing department.  Overcharged four months in a row, called every month and was repeatedly told it would be fixed.  I went to American Express to file a dispute and at least they were able to reverse the four overcharges.  Even after that, I was randomly charged for a system upgrade that never happened.  I am considering filing a complaint with the better business bureau and the attorney general."
"If I could leave ADT Security a negative review I would.  This is the worst company as far as billing & customer service are concerned.  I work for a General Contractor on the West Coast and we use ADT for our clients.  Security patrol is standard, but the problem is that their invoices are obscure to the point of insensible, referencing 3 other invoices that were never received.  The only way that you can view the invoices is to login to their website with a password no one has, from a letter that is only mailed out the jobsite.  I AM NOT AT THE JOBSITE WHERE CONSTRUCTION IS DONE, I am in the business office where we pay bills.  Their CSRs put you on hold for 10-15 minutes at a time only to tell you lies about what they can do, then you have to call back and deal with them all over again when the lies are uncovered.  They are the worst company, do yourself a favor and stay away from them."
"Awful customer service, they tell you one price and its COMPLETELY not enough security to cover a small house...., then they charge you a ton to actually secure your house.... Only telling you AFTER it was installed (holes in your wall for keypad and drilling in your ceiling for smoke detector). when you try to cancel it takes forever and THEY ARE RUDE!!! My advice ...... DONT USE ADT!!!!!!! Save your money and give it to an honest company not this awful one!!!"
"Awful service; took us 2 and a half hours to get our food and the waiter forgot several items (then added a few beers we didn't order on to our tab; I'm assuming because he thought we were too drunk to notice.) Then we find out that after we had nicely split the tab for them (even adding in an extra $10 on top of the grat because we were too lazy to re-do the math) that they wouldn't split the check? In the time we argued about it, you could have run the 3 credit cards we had and been done with it.Had to argue with the manager (who was completely unhelpful, with one of the waiters standing behind her and being rude to me for backup) for 10 minutes and they didn't give us an inch. I would have stiffed the waiter for the awful service if I could have; but we got gratted so I didn't even have that option.If you want to come here with more than 3 people, avoid D's. Their beer is severely overpriced ($10 for a beer I can get at Sharp Edge for $6? no thanks!) and the food is the same fried garbage covered in cheese you can get at any other bar in Pittsburgh.In other words, don't come here. I used to like this place, but tonight was such a bad experience I'll just go to one of the other places in Pittsburgh that serves hot dogs, french fries and beer. There are plenty of them, I won't miss D's at all."
"Over-hyped food, rude service, don't care about their customers.  What happens when the owner values money over ""being there"" to oversee the business.  I'm a local and have been going to D's since they opened...but that doesn't matter any more....with the exception of Eli, the bartenders are generally rude.  Food is sub-par...seems the busier they are,  the worse the food is.  What a shame.  It used to be my ""go to"" place in the 'Square, where I would take out-of -towners or go after a mountain bike ride in Frick.  Despite the numbers of great beers, I can't justify giving my money to a place that doesn't care about their customers."
"While awaiting the arrival of your wedding dress, you should feel excitement and joy, not desparation and hopelessness.  The delivery date was ""pushed back"" many times until it finally came in over 3 months after they said it would, and gave me the run-around throughout the entire process.  I didn't think my dress was coming at all to be perfectly honest.  I had un-returned phone calls and was lied to by Donetta, the owner.  Janie was the consultant I worked with the most and she was always pleasant and helpful; however, the store overall struggles and I would never go back.  If you are shopping for a wedding dress run far far away from this place.  Seriously, take my word for it.  I ordered my dress well in advance and no one should go through what I went through wondering when you were going to get a straight answer and if your dress was ever going to come.  I have read many negative reviews for this place and still gave them the benefit of the doubt. Shame on me.  Check out the Better Business Bureau (BBB).  Brides by Candalina is rated an F.  They have unresolved isssues with customers and unfortunately they really don't care. Shopping for a wedding dress should be one of the most exciting times of your life, not a nightmare.  There are many other bridal shops-avoid this one."
"I went to pick up my wife's bridesmaid dress (she was the maid of honor) on a very boring Wednesday afternoon around 12:30. From the outside the place looks like a bomb shelter with dresses in the window.The show room is upstairs, but you would never know it from the drab, basement-like entrance. As I walked up the stairs I notices ZERO customers in the store, however; two employees were working on the sales floor. I stood there like a jerk for a bit while both employees (one was the owner) kept to themselves. The owner did not respond to me for, at least, 10 minutes even though the store was empty and another employee was just walking around ""dusting"" (the store smalls like the inside of a mascot costume).When the owner, finally, saw me she made a little annoying noise like ""What the hell are YOU doing here!!"". She walked over slowly, like a zombie looking for fresh brains and giving a crap why I was there. She asked me to follow her as she took me downstairs to an absolutely empty storeroom (by that I mean: what was she doing that was was so important that she couldn't wait on a customer) and took her sweet-ass time to get the dress which, by the way, was a second alteration. You see, they screwed up the first time they altered the dress (even after my wife tried it on there and markings or whatever were made!). So everyone is entitled to a mistake even a business that claims perfection; it's important to give them a chance to redeem themselves. But, to my surprise, she handed me a bill for the second alteration!!!!!! Are you kidding me?!!!I argued a bit, but then gave in; what was I supposed to do? We were leaving to go 200 miles away the next day for the wedding. So I paid. Do not go here ladies!Oh, if you think I'm exaggerating, feel free to Google this company and read the many reviews that make mine look like a compliment. If you have ever needed a dress for a wedding or YOUR wedding, these reviews will scare you!"
"AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE!Attendant woke up on the wrong side of the bed! She was sooooo rude. Here is my story: My friend and I walked in and started going upstairs, as the sign indicates you should. A voice from downstairs says ""I'm down here."" So we turn around and start going down. She then starts up the stairs and says ""no go upstairs."" She asked what I was there for and I told her I was in for a appointment to look at wedding dresses. And then she said ""No, what KIND of dress."" A little taken, I calmly told her the style I liked. She took me into the room of dresses and said to look around. She did not offer to pull for me (she knows her stock, not me.) I found one dress I had a mild interest in trying on. She asked if I needed help trying it on. At this point, in no mood to deal with her, I said my friend would help me. We took the dress in the fitting room and noticed it was dirty and tattered. We tried it on as best we could (if anyone has tried wedding dresses on, you know how difficult that can be). As fast as we got it on, is as fast as we took it off and booked it to the door. No way I was placing the responsibility of ordering and altering a dress for my wedding day in this shop's hands. They can't even give you the courtesy of trying on their dresses.All I can figure is this lady has zero patience and should not be working with the public. Sheesh!"
"I ordered a bridesmaid dress here when my best friend got married and I had a good experience. So I had high hopes that my 9(!) bridesmaids would also have a good experience.The pros: the dresses are beautiful and the prices are good! Overall, I loved my bridesmaid dresses.But getting to that point was one disaster after another.  I had my bridesmaids pick from two different styles of dresses. Two bridesmaids and my maid of honor lived out of town and we were told they could order over the phone. So after that was all taken care of... We waited and waited and waited. We ordered on February 1st. I was told that because of Chinese New Year (the dresses come from china) it would take about 10-12 weeks for them to come in. At the end of May, I called just to check in about my order. The girl who answered sounded confused and told me she'd have someone call me back. No one ever called. So I called again after a week and was told there was no way to track my order and that I'd have to continue waiting.Then, in June, my maid of honor calls me. She got a bridesmaid dress in the mail! Yay! But it was not the dress she ordered. Not even close. In fact, it had some other girl's name on it and a different wedding date. It was a dress from someone else's wedding. I had to travel back to the store to return that particular dress.Fast forward to July (5 weeks before the wedding). The dresses finally arrive! They are the right sizes! The colors are pretty! I am relieved.... Until my one bridesmaid from out of town calls me to tell me they ordered her the wrong style dress. She's an easy-going gal and normally this wouldn't be a concern, but she had just given birth and was nursing and the dress they sent her was strapless and a little skimpy. I called to see how Candalina could possibly amend this and was told (by the owner's wife) that she shouldn't have ordered over the phone and that it must have been her fault for ordering the wrong dress! I asked to talk to the owner, but was told he was out of town. So now I'm pretty livid. I travel there AGAIN to see if I could talk to someone in person. The woman who was there was very understanding, but couldn't really help me. She said there was no time to order another dress. No time to get additional fabric. She suggested buying a shrug in a ""close color""In the end, that bridesmaid got a partial refund for the dress. But that was after MUCH time and effort and after many conversations. This experience was not worth the beautiful dresses. Save yourself the headache and stay away from this establishment. Planning a wedding is stressful enough, you don't need to deal with this mess of a business on top of it."
"Last Friday I dropped off my best interview suit at Regency Cleaners and verified that I needed it back by Monday because of an interview on Wednesday. They assured me I could pick it up on Monday morning. Monday afternoon I stopped by and was told the suit wouldn't be there until 5:00PM. When I insisted that I had been told morning, she went into the back and came out with what I first thought was the suit but turned out to be only the jacket. She told me to come back after 5:00PM. When I asked to speak with the manager, she informed me that she was the only person there. I asked her to have the manager call me - she said the manager wouldn't answer the phone and reiterated the 5:00PM time when the last delivery came and petulantly informed me that none of this was her fault.At 5:30PM I called and was told that the last delivery hadn't come yet and I'd have to call later. I again asked them to have the manager call me and she told me she couldn't give me the manager's phone number - which I hadn't asked for. I was again told this wasn't her fault. As of 7:00PM, the delivery finally arrived but not my pants.I was told the manager would call me after she arrived in the morning. I finally called at 9:00AM and was criticized by the manager for demanding her home phone number and told that there was never any guarantee about when clothes would be returned even when a rush was placed on them. Apparently a *lot* of clothes were missing from the Monday delivery so I wasn't the only person upset about this situation.When I told them they'd lost my business for good, I was told that was fine and hung up on, forcing me to call again to find out exactly *when* I might be able to expect my missing pants.At this point I'm still waiting and will be for the next three hours. In the meantime, I have to go out and try to find a suit that I can afford as a replacement just in case. I absolutely cannot recommend Regency Cleaners. They leave high school kids with no customer service experience or training in charge of the store with no manager available for unexpected situations. And there is no guarantee about when or if your clothes will ever come back.This was my first and last time dealing with them."
"Worst dry cleaners EVER.  Not only do they do an incredibly poor job on the clothes, but the staff are particularly nasty and rude.  The kids who work there are fine, but the older ladies are just plain miserable.  I would rather spend more money someplace else than go back to this hell hole."
"I have been in this bar many times with a friend of mine (who has been a patron for decades) and I thought the owners were really nice people but now I wonder.  My friend is now confined to a wheelchair and still likes to frequent this bar, however, there are a couple of steps that lead into the back rooms where there are pool tables, dart boards, etc.  She cannot get to this area and has a ramp that she would give to the owners so she can access this area.  They refuse to put in the ramp.  I thought all public businesses had to comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act as long as it does not create an undue hardship.  Tell me, how is putting down a ramp that is given to you for free a hardship!  SHAME ON YOU CATHY!"
"Let me start off by saying, I HATE the dentist.  It is my worst fear.  I came to Edgewood Dental after stellar reviews.. and let me tell you my first impression was amazing.  They were professional, so nice, easily scheduled me in and numbed me so much that I didn't feel a thing.  Although I had 7 cavities filled (my teeth are horrible) I felt good that they did a good job.  Flash forward 3 months later, I received a bill in the mail because my insurance downgraded and no longer covered white fillings.  First, I was very upset that I was never told of this downgrade.  I was given an estimate and paid on time in full - not sure when this changed or why I was never told by the office or insurance company.  Regardless, I called over 5 times to discuss a payment plan with the office.  When I first emailed them, I was told I could choose the amount with which I wanted to pay to cover the amount owed.  Then, I was told my amount was too low and would get a call back.  NEVER HEARD FROM THEM AGAIN.  I was very upset.  I emailed, and called so many times.  Meanwhile, I have always paid everything on time and as an upstanding person would never not pay a bill.  I have been sending them checks and they are cashing them and just not even saying a word.  Jerks."
"I live in Regent Square and have been to Dunning.s about a half-dozen times over the past several years.  It was never a great restaurant, in fact, it was never even an average restaurant.  At best, the food was mediocre, and the only time that I would eat here was when I was too tired to get in my car and travel the three or so miles to the Union Grill in Oakland (which offers similar fare as Dunning.s - and does an incomparably better job of it).Recently, however, things have taken a nosedive at Dunning's.  I now consider Dunning's to be the single worst restaurant in the city that I've ever had the misfortune of entering.  I recently had the worst restaurant service experience of my life at Dunning's when our waitress first ignored our party, then hurried us through our order, then left us sit for over 20 minutes waiting for food with empty drinks.  We then received terrible food (soggy sandwiches, brown lettuce in a salad, and cold french fries - stone cold), and when we complained about our fries, the waitress launched into an angry tirade (nearly yelling at us) about how it wasn't her fault, that she just picks up the food, and that there wasn't anything she could do about it.  When I asked to speak to the manager, he just shook his head sadly and offered us free desserts.  I told him that I didn't want to eat anything that came out of a kitchen that clearly showed that the people working in it simply didn't care - at all, and we didn't want to eat anything, not even the food sitting in front of us, and just wanted to pay our bill and leave.  He said that he was going to ""comp"" our meal.  It was a disastrous experience - the single worst restaurant experience of my life - and I will never return until the restaurant is under new management.  It is crystal-clear that the current manager and/or owner isn't doing his job, and I cannot understand how anyone would choose to spend their hard-earned money at this establishment when virtually every other restaurant in town offers far better service and food.  In short: no one - not the manager, not the waitresses, not the cooks - cares about the customer.  Not at all."
"I've lived around the corner from here for about 2 years and just stopped by for the first time a few weeks ago- I regret this decision.It seems like a neighborhood-type place where people just keep coming back because they've been going for years. Mostly older clientele and families with young kids. We were there around 6pm on a Saturday. It filled up pretty quickly after that. I ordered the steak bruschetta, medium. The flavor was good, but the meat was so chewy I couldn't swallow anything larger than a dime-sized chunk. The garlic toast that the meat/tomatoes were on was burnt.Someone else in my party ordered the soup of the day- I don't remember what it was but it looked like green mush. She didn't like it, and politely mentioned to the server that she didn't enjoy it. The server said that they had been thinking the same thing- they wouldn't want to try it either- and took it away without offering an apology or a replacement. I wasn't expecting a 5-star restaurant walking into this place, but I expected more than crappy service and bad food. There are so many better places on that block of Braddock alone- go somewhere else."
"This place continues to be a joke.  The service is bad and the attitude of the workers is worse.  My order is never right and yet I still go...never again.  I officially deem this place the worst restaurant in Pittsburgh."
Worst service.  Dirty.  Slow.  Ignorant by the strictest definition.  Do not go here.  Bad!  Real bad.
"Inattentive staff.  Dirty tables, I agree with the other reviews here.  I think the ""Manager"" only hires other smokers, and they spend 90% of their time sitting outside smoking, instead of being prepared to serve customers.  I go there because sometimes it's convenient, b/c of the location, but last week they left their A/C broken for over a week (in 80+ degree weather).  No additional fans, nothing.Then when it was fixed, I went in, ordered coffee and an order of hummus/carrot/celery (prepackaged).  Not only was the hummus watery from sitting in that container for several days, but the celery was rotting at the ends, yes brown and rotting.  I showed the kid working there, who was probably jonesing to have his next cigarette, and I asked for another one.  Without opening it I could see at least 2-3 of the other servings of hummus were also all watery and had celery that was starting to rot, just like the one I was given.  I asked for my money back.  You know what was the worst thing, though?  The kid (he knows nothing about customer service let alone food service) put the containers with the watery, rotting celery back in the case, to serve to other unsuspecting customers!  Hello, Allegheny County Health Department?....Then the ultimate insult: 2 kids came in selling candy bars.  I've seen this there before, but this time, I said to them: ""You know, this is a business, you shouldn't be here.""  Well, the older of the 2 girls (probably 11-12 at most - where is her mother?) put her hands on her hips and said in a smart-ass tone: ""We asked da owner, we is allowed ta be here.""Well, that coffee I spent $2 on?  That is the last money I will spend in that place.  Disgusting."
"My guess is that ""Ruth K."" was put up to writing a nice review by the staff or owner.  Regent Square deserves a better coffee shop, run by someone with good business sense.  What kind of a ""business"" only prepares food (chicken/tuna salad, hummus) once a week?  Does chicken salad hold a week in your fridge?  Also, whenever they lose an employee, they just shuffle their schedule and close at 6 pm for a few months.  They should be open till 10 pm as it is, with all the foot traffic in the neighborhood, especially in the summer. My guess is they see this place as nothing more than a loss leader for the bar they own next door.   Otherwise you would think that since opening in 1995 they could at least take the time to slap a coat of fresh paint on the place!BTW, Katerbean did go smoke free before the Allegheny County ordinance went into effect, but the place to this day reeks of stale smoke.Added note: looks like my previous review was somehow deleted.  I'll just say I received an order of hummus that was watery and had rotting celery in it.  Tried to get another and 3 or 4 of the orders in the case were all in the same condition. I asked for a refund, and afterwards watched the kid working there put the other containers back in the cooler to sell to other customers. That was the last straw.  I won't spend another dollar there."
"I really want this place to be awesome, because, yet again, I want Regent Square to be an up and coming area.  This place has been here for years, and as I sit drinking my bitter, bitter coffee, and smelling the overwhelming scent of (I believe) dog pee, I wonder how it's even possible.  The three times I've been here, I'm greeted as if I'm a colonial space marine trying to fish a child out of a vent.  They always sit in the corner peeking over the top of the counter as if I am terrifying to them, then duck out of the way.  Then grudgingly come when I peek around the counter at them.  If I didn't, I'm convinced that they would just sit there, as if they're not certain of what position they hold in this place, or what the next step should even be.  This is what I like to call, ""The Dance of Shitty Customer Service.""  Today (and I write this longingly looking over at Square Cafe) I decided to give it a chance because it never is crowded, and I figured the quiet would be a good thing.  The girl at the counter was on the phone, and that's the way it stayed for two minutes until I said 'excuse me?'.  The charming reply: ""Yeah?"" She grudgingly got off the phone, and after accomplishing the Herculean task of handing me a cup, I pumped this swill that I'm currently drinking.She's currently muttering under her breath back in her corner.  I'm not sure if maybe she's having a bad day, or she's just an asshole, but...if I had to bet, I'm going with asshole.This place has pretty expensive coffee for how awful it is, and the food...Just don't eat the food.  (side note: this place isn't quiet at all when somebody orders something.  She stomps around like she's being sent to her room.  Then continues muttering)Okay, so this place is a travesty.  Bad coffee, bad odor, bad lighting, unbelievably bad, grudging service.  I would beg the owners to put any effort into this place.  As it is now, it's cornered the market in Regent Square, and sits like a middle finger boastfully pointing at the people of Braddock Avenue."
"Ughhhh, Katerbean is the abusive boyfriend that I keep coming back to and hate myself for it. There is nothing else around and convenience wins today due to the snow, and my extreme exhaustion and need for caffiene.Why, do you ask? I just asked the gal behind the counter, kindly, if I could borrow a pen for a moment. I got an annoyed sigh, an eye roll  and zero eyecontact. Really? I asked for a pen, not a kidney. My pleading for a coffee shop intervention from someone, anyone, is now a red alert! Help us RS residents, please!"
"Is it possible to give zero stars?  If so, Katerbean would rate a zero.Bad atmosphere, unfriendly employees, slow and reluctant service, pump your own coffee, dingy interior, dirty tables.  If they only had telescreens which couldn't be switched off, then this place would be a perfect setting to film Orwell's ""1984""."
This place is now closed :-). Best thing that could've been done with it.  Going to opn in a couple of months under new management as the 61B cafÌ©. I look forward to seeing what some new life does to this place!
"Horrible, discourteous owner and inept service people.  No way would I ever recommend this place."
"Very poor service, no coordination between staff. Went to the store, explained to the woman there what we are trying to do, she gave some Schpeel about how they have been in business doing this for 50 or so years. Took an appointment with their installer to come give an estimate. The appointment was 2 weeks out between 9-1. On the day if the appointment, I take a day off from work, the dad calls at 8:50am asks what the job is, and states they don't do that work .If you need to buy appliances go to a big box, they are cheaper, if you need anything else, stay away from these guys."
Wow my first one star review so you know it was bad!  We found this place through our Home Warranty Company.  Our dishwasher was broken when we moved into our new house. The sellers were supposed to have it fixed by this company before we moved in however it was still not working on move-in day-would not drain.  I called Perla and they had no record of being out to our place to fix the dishwasher (sellers did pay for it) and said they think they had the wrong zip code written down and could not find the house. I mean are you kidding me??!!  So we scheduled an appointment for a service man to come out. This took several calls as they rarely answer their phone and one lady is extremely rude whenever she answers.  The service man was scheduled to come in a week between 1-4pm.  He shows up at 4:30 because he typed the wrong house address into his GPS instead of going to the appointment scheduled before us. Well lucky us.  He recommends we get a new dishwasher as it would be cheaper than fixing and he leaves after 10 minutes. The home warranty company says otherwise and tell Perla they will pay for the parts.  Perla never calls to make another appointment so again I have to call about 5 times until I can get someone on the phone to schedule a second appointment.  We were told the parts they ordered had come in.  The day they were supposed to arrive we did not get a call so I called and they said they cannot find the parts they ordered for us. Another are you kidding me!!  Two weeks ago they said the parts had arrived. They said they would call back if they find the parts and never do.  Meanwhile we are waiting at home for them to arrive.  I call them back and the parts have been found and I demand they tell me when they will be coming. In an hour they finally show up and fix our dishwasher.  So far so good but honestly I would have rather bought a new dishwasher at Lowes and been saved the headache of dealing with this company. Stay far away from them for your appliance repairs.
"I purchased a through the wall air conditioning unit three years ago from Perla's Appliances. The customer service wasn't the greatest, but the 18,000 btu units were limited in this region at the time. After installation was completed the unit performed very well, until July 2015 when it no longer produced cool air. The unit was removed and taken to the shop for repair and has remained at Perla's ever since. After leaving numerous messages with no return call I stopped at the shop on a Friday & found nothing had been done. It was said of Rocco he needed to consult with a colleague and he'd call by mid-week; he never called.  As of yesterday I contacted the manufacturer to see what can be done. I would give a zero rating, but that's not permitted."
"purchased several appliances from perla, had an issue with the washer. after it was repaired INCORRECTLY, called to have it repaired AGAIN. took off work and waited all day to find at 6 pm the work order had been CANCELED. cslled to see what could be done and was THREATENED by perla to be shot! now he won't fix my waher. POOR SERVICE"
"RACIST, CLASSIST, or both. Great pizza, wish I wasn't excluded for bullshit reasons.They would deliver to me when I was a six minute drive away from them to my workplace in Wilkinsburg (which is located a couple of block from Regent Square.) Yelled at me ""WE DON'T DELIVER TO WILKINSBURG"" when ordering from my home which is also a six minute drive away but, four blocks from the regent squarish area of Wilkinsburg.  I understand delivery cutoff points but, when I asked where these were :::BY THE OWNER::: ""We just don't deliver there... we don't deliver to your street... I DON't KNOW WHERE THE CUTOFF IS. WE JUST DON'T GO THERE.""Ended up ordering from a pizza place in squirrel hill. And they deliver from a whole nine minutes away!"
This store is so gross that I was almost sick! Onions peeled and half-rotten. Squishy garlic. Dirt everywhere. I will NEVER step foot in this place again.
Security guard confronted me at the door at 10:50 pm like I was scum and an idiot for shopping near the end of his shift/closing time. He wanted to know what I was going to get. I told him some stuff. He told me I had about 3 minutes to get it. I informed him I had about 10 minutes. He told me I would be out of the store by 11. He proceeded to follow me through the store. I sought out the manager who seemed to think this was great customer service. I left my intended purchases and walked out without buying. I haven't been back since. I am a professional. I had taken off my tie and my sleeves were rolled up a 1/4.   Made an online complaint. No reply.
One of the worst Wendy's I've ever experienced.  Every morning there was a 30-minute wait - after ordering - for food.
"Didn't get all of the items I ordered AND PAID FOR! What's worse is, I wasn't given a receipt so I can't even prove they forgot to give me something! When I called corporate to tell them of this, they said I could just go back and since I had some food in hand that I should get what was missing... with no receipt (I don't think so) she decided to give me the store number instead so I can inform the manager before driving there. So they gave me the number and all it is is BUSY, the few times you can get through it's a dial-up set of tones that are ear piercing! We also didn't get straws, or utensils for our food. Though, there wasn't hardly any wait at all so I must have been lucky there, but not lucky enough for good service!"
"Wow. I hope that the one experience I had here was unique and not the norm for frequent customers. All I wanted to do was to buy some thermal socks (which they didn't even have any for men!  ???). I just ended up grabbing the next best thing (Oddly, they did have thermal socks for women which I almost purchased). I go stand in the check out line, and I don't think I've ever dealt with slower people than those who work here (and that's saying something). Not one, but two of the registers I stood in line at froze, and the women had to wait for the manager to fix.  They didn't seem to mind at all, which leads me to believe this happens all of the time. I waited for my beau who bought something after I did: another 15 minute wait.  Needless to say, I will not go here again."
"First off, I like family restaurants and avoid chains when possible. Sometimes that's not possible - in the future I'll avoid this one no matter what.Its always a zoo, the servers are not interested in what they are doing, and do it poorly. Food comes out of order or not at all. The managers don't care. We actually had a waitress spill the soup, catch most of it in her hand, and dump it back in right in front of us. Then she gave it to us before thinking to ask if we wanted another. Just go anywhere else, it can't be worse!"
"Normally one would think, one chain restaurant is just like the rest but I have had nothing but problems here. The staff appears to be constantly changing as does the managers which should tell you something. I've been there for lunch and dinner and continue to have issues. Here are just some of the problems that we have had: a co-worker had an entire glass of iced tea dropped on him and nothing was comped on his check; we have had to wait a very long time for our orders to be taken; I ordered the pick 2 and was told that the soup could not possibly come out first(even though I've done this before); they have argued with us over what the meal is supposed to come with to the point of us showing them a picture; and staff does not appear to be properly trained."
"Another overdone steak and utterly inattentive staff! Still sitting here waiting for someone to give a care.So, we finally got the attention of a server who was not our server, Michael. She was kind enough to take my steak back to the kitchen. Michael, our server, finally shows up 10 minutes later with a half-hearted apology and to let me know that my steak was being prepared again. He does not offer to refill our drink glasses that have now been sitting empty for 20 minutes. The manager makes an appearance and brings me a strip steak that looks rare from the sight of it. He informs me that my steak is on him and apologizes. He goes away. I cut into my steak and it's, you guessed it, Pittsburgh Rare. I asked for medium rare. He returns and I tell him that the chef needs to go back to culinary school and learn how to prepare a steak. The manager apologizes again and asks me if I want to take this pathetic piece of beef home with me! Not only is it rare but it's a cheap cut of strip steak that is loaded with connective gristle. I said no thanks. He comped my husband's meal and we left. I never hope for people to lose their jobs but the cook and the server really need some serious retraining! I will never go back to this Applebee's again."
"Takeout is a mess at this location. In the past I've had to wait 30 minutes past the time they gave for pickup, and sit on hold for 15+ minutes only to find out it was because they didn't have anyone manning the phone. The last time they didn't include an entree we'd ordered, and a month later have failed to send a gift card to make up for the cost."
"Benihana.  It's just rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?  No, unfortunately not.at.all...anymore.  From hence forth, all mentions of Benihana are likely to cause anxiety in my usually calm heart.  I hate complaining like this. I really do. But sometimes, you just have to, ya know?Tuesday evening I met a group of friends for a birthday dinner.  The reservation for our party of nine was for 7:00pm.  All but one of our party arrived prior to 7:00, but the hostess was curt in explaining that all party members needed to be present before we were seated, as our chef would be ready to begin meal preparation as soon as we were seated.  Fortunately, the final member of our party arrived shortly and we were seated at 7:05pm.  It was not until 7:40pm that first contact with our server was made. Without any apology for the delay she took our drink orders.  She (name withheld because I don't want to be rude) returned more than 10 minutes later with our drinks, but waited another 10-15 minutes after that to take our dinner orders.  As I was waiting I looked over at the table next to us, who were also clearly celebrating a child's birthday.  At one point the mother (I'm assuming) smiled at me and said, ""I hope you get out before midnight. We've been here over two hours.  We're taking our cake and getting out of here.""Upon taking our orders, one of our guests explained that due to a shrimp allergy it was necessary to cook any shrimp ordered by our group in another area (a neighboring grill, etc.).  Our server said that she would have to ask the manager, who came to our table shortly thereafter.  When the manager arrived at the table my guest explained her allergy and his response was that it might be in her best interest to leave.  I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt that he meant leaving the table, not the restaurant, but I'm not certain of this. Following this recommendation he mentioned that she could wait in the bar as the rest of us dined table-side.  I asked him why it was not an option to prepare the shrimp at a neighboring table, but he expressed concern that other customers may require the use of the other available tables.  I understand his point, but the restaurant was near-empty as the hour quickly approached 8:30pm.  Finally, he offered to prepare the shrimp portions of our meals in the kitchen.  I'm not sure why this wasn't initially mentioned as an option, but I'll leave it at that.  Our chef Tom eventually arrived at our table. He was very pleasant and efficient during the course of our meal preparation.  During his time at the table my Emperor's Salad was delivered, as were the majority of my table's sushi orders.  However, two of our guests that ordered sushi were not served at this time.  In fact, they were not served until a full 10 minutes after the rest of our party finished our meals.  At one point, they inquired about the delay to she-whose-name-shall-not-be-mentioned, who responded that they were ""waiting for the rice.""  When she delivered their food there was not a single mention of the delay.  Two hours and thirty+ minutes after we arrived at Benihana, we left.  From start to finish, the entire evening was a terrible experience.  It was ridiculous to the point that there was not even soap or toilet paper available in the restroom.  Were it not for the kindness and professionalism of Tom (and the awesome company of friends), the night would have been a complete waste.  My final thought is this. The food was fine, but because I was feeling particularly piggish on this Tuesday evening, I enjoyed two California rolls from my stash of Costco sushi at home before departing for the restaurant. The difference between Costco's rolls and Benihana's...a toss up - just sayin.  The good news is, this will give my friends something to whine about for YEARS to come..."
"Many great memories and great experience at Benihana BUT last night WAS NOT! Horrible service! Took 15 mins to even take a drink order...then when I had a question about a speciality wine the waiter says he didn't know so ok no big deal, could he go find.. NO! Told me to go the bar and ask the bartender. Really?!? Then the chef came out and was pretty good although cooked everything separate starting  with only onions and zucchini, where's the veggies?? From start to finish it was about half an hour! If we ate the dinner as a whole it would've been cold.. So we ate as we went. Also drink refills were a tough task too.. the chef had to keep asking other servers to assist. few and far between!! We had 3 birthdays at our table.. Not one song , which I didn't care, not one complimentary picture, no dessert was offered until another customer said something. Then the bill.. Oh the bill... That took another 15 mins!! At this point I told my family to go ahead home and I will wait considering this overall experience was almost a 2 hour ordeal. I was double charged on two items. At this point I was DONE dealing with this incompetent and appethetic waiter!!! Went to settle my bill with the manager who was nice and accommodating. Rectified the errors. And was generous with a $20 refund! I told him about the experience and all he said was ""I can take picture now for you"" UM... I was by myself!!! No thanks! One last thing, the male greeter needs some drug intervention.. He was high as a kite and made my daughter & I feel very uncomfortable to the point of invading our personal space and staring with those glazed over eyes as he staggered to and from his post. WOW & BOO!!! And sad : ("
"This is by the far the worst hibachi restaurant I have eaten at. The food is very bland from the onion soup to the fried rice (which basically was white rice with chopped onions) to the chicken (which was so pale it looked like it was boiled). Hibachi food typically has tons of flavor and tastes good because it has some grill marks and char, which none of our food had. I question whether it was even cooked on the hibachi table (we ate at a regular table but ordered from the hibachi menu). Not only was the food bad but the service was terrible. Our waiter didn't even know that hibachi dinners should come with the two sauces, he acted confused when I asked for them. Additionally, we ordered a sushi roll for an appetizer and instead of getting it before dinner, we received it after our dinner even though we saw it sitting at the sushi bar for a good 15 minutes beforehand. This restaurant may have been around for a long time but it doesn't even compare to other hibachi restaurants and was more expensive than any other I've eaten at."
This place is crappy the only veggies u get is onions and zucchinis took the server 30 min to serv us drinks then took them 20 min to take orders by the time the chef comes out already an hour just for the food and the show after we ate our waiter didnt even recommend anny desserts just gave us the chek and leave with out saying anny thing els o i for got we were still eating like wtf im still eating and so was mi family and u just give me the check the chef just left like five min ago . I recamen go sime where els n eat
"This is the WORST Hibachi I have ever had.  We came here for a friends birthday, and I will never be going back. Service was mediocre, but the food was the real travesty.You go to Hibachi for a show, but it's not fun when the cook makes the SAME Giant Eagle joke the entire time.  He also couldn't perform all the tricks that are pretty standard from Hibachi chefs.  The food. Not good.  My boyfriend ordered tofu and it was cold in the middle.  He didn't bother to have the guy heat it more, b/c it would have just been a hassle.  The chef forgot one friends meal completely and got rude with the server.  Then after everything was cooked, he looked at me and asked did you eat all your shrimp. I replied ""no, you never served me any."" (I had ordered the chicken and shrimp.)  He then sends the server back into the kitchen to get more. By the time they were cooked, everyone was finished eating.  Come on.  To make matters worse, when we left we saw that he was the head chef. That doesn't say too much for the rest of them. I don't know how people keep coming here.  There is WAY better hibachi in Pittsburgh, for a lot less money.  I mean honestly, I paid $9.50 for a glass of Kendall Jackson. No. The best part of the meal were the cupcakes that my friend brought.  Do your wallet and your stomach a favor and go to a different Hibachi place.  Benihana is not worth your time or money."
"My family and I have been going to Benihana for about 5 years now. We've always had to wait at least a half an hour to be seated, even when we've had reservations. In the past its been forgivable, mostly because its close to home for us, the food is okay (albeit a little pricey), and my Grandmother absolutely loves the entertainment of hibachi. But that all changed last night when we went out with a party of 8 for my and my mothers birthday. I made reservations two weeks in advance for our birthday dinner. When I called they were almost totally booked and only had a few spots left that evening. Our reservations were for 7:30. We arrive a little early at 7:20 and I let the hostess know that we are there and she checks us in. Then we basically just wait and wait and wait. We notice the hostess turning people away, and we notice two tables who have been seated for about 30 minutes now haven't even gotten their soups or salads. By now its nearly 8 O'clock. Then my mother overhears the hostess telling someone that they are short staffed and the wait is going to be extremely long. By this point we've been waiting for 45 minutes. My sister takes a walk through the restaurant and notices there is only 1 hibachi chef working, but there are SEVEN tables seated, all waiting for food/drinks. So I ask the hostess how much longer before we are seated. She informs me that it will be at least another half an hour before we get a table, because two hibachi chefs and two kitchen chefs called off sick. It would be another hour after were seated before they would even start taking our food orders. This is TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. First of all, the hostess should have informed us when we arrived that they were short staffed and we would have a very very long wait. OR, the manager should have phoned people with reservations and asked if they could reschedule. Either way, we should have been informed instead of letting us stand in the lobby for an hour, not knowing that it would be another hour and a half before we would actually eat, on an evening when we had reservations. We decided to call Ichiban to see if they could accommodate us. They told us we could walk right in and be seated immediately. As we were leaving we ran into a gentleman who was outside smoking who told us that his party had reservations for 6:30 and they still had not ordered their food! It was now about 8:20pm. Our first dinner at Ichiban actually turned out to be much better than our previous dinners at Benihana, so I don't think we'll ever be going back there. I think Ichiban will be our new hibachi restaurant of choice."
"Never again. As a life long South Hills resident,  BeniHana used to be ""the place"" to go.  Birthdays, special occasions, date nights,etc...  ""used to""  is the key statement here.  This place has gone so downhill, it's no where near the quality it once was.A wait even with a reservation, a wait for every single thing we needed or requested,Over priced sake (for basically a slightly larger than a shot glass size amount) , an up charge for fried rice,  lukewarm tea ( for the record, everyone is supposed to get tea with the meal and no one did, i had to ask for it),  a ""chef"" that responded ""I'm very tired"" when asked ""how are you this evening"" .  The ""chef"" did zero ""show"" while cooking the food very  very slowly. I repeat, ZERO  presentation, isn't that what half of the ""Benihana"" dinner is supposed to be?!   We ate our steak and chicken with what  remained of the zucchini/ onions and what remained of the rice that was presented way in advance of the meat.    This was by far one of the most disappointing dinners ever.   I give one star because the food still tasted good, but everything else was dismal.   Dirty, stained menus, dirty floor around us, a lackluster cook, a server who was slow and over priced cocktails. We had a 7:30 pm reservation and left a little after 10:00 and not because we were having such a good time, it took 2 1/2 hours to complete this meal.  Unacceptable. I will never , ever go back here and I will tell everyone I know to spend their money elsewhere."
"Where do I start?  The horrible location?  The hostess that had little to nothing to say prior or during our seating?  Or do I skip right to the waiter?  For those of you who have lack of taste, enjoy employees at a restaurant that seem they could not care less about their job, or even enjoy sushi not made the correct way,  Even if you love establishments that hire employees that seem to not care for quality of food or knowledge of food.  I HIGHLY suggest you go here.When we arrived at this location (which opened up 15 minutes prior to us getting there) we noticed a few individuals already sitting at their tables enjoying themselves, so we figured we'd be sat right away.  Instead we were then informed by the hostess to please wait for a few minutes because they were getting our table ready.  Ready for what?  We weren't even asked how many individuals would be dining nor if we wanted Hibachi or the sushi bar.  After we found a seat by ourselves we awaited approximately for about 10 minutes for a waiter to give us our menus.  After receiving our menus from our mute friendly waiter we were asked if we were ready to place our order.  Our starters consisted of Spicy Seafood soup, Edimame, and Shrimp Tempura.  After a few more minutes we decided we wanted to enjoy Sushi for lunch and so we placed our order to the waiter and asked if our starters were about ready in which he replied yes they should be out shortly.  Instead 2 of our 4 Sushi orders come out followed by Edimame and then followed by the Shrimp Tempura 5 minutes after that.  We then proceeded to ask about the soup and rest of our Sushi order, we were informed the soup takes a very long time and that the Sushi was being made still.  (we understood why the Sushi may take a little more time due to what we ordered)  The Edimame was very delicious, but the Shrimp Tempura had me baffled at what we had ordered and why the cost was $8 for the very small portioned flavorless Tempura, which included I'm assuming a thousand island dressing for some reason?  It was definitely not your normal Tempura sauce in which we've enjoyed many times before in other Benihana locations.  As we get our 2nd batch of Sushi our soup was still NOT ready.  Is this a lack of service, food staff, or poor kitchen management with untrained so called ""Chefs""?  We decided it was best to simply cancel the soup in which then we were coincidentally informed the soup was ready and if we still wanted it.  During this whole ordeal, we had not seen our original waiter since we had placed our orders and instead had 2 other employees that had no clue what we ordered and had to run back and forth asking what we had and what we were waiting for still.  I wouldn't have minded being informed our original waiter was busy and they were going to take over for him, had our order been alright, or even if had our food been tasty.  The Tempura was horrible, the Sushi was questionable, and the service was beyond ridiculous.  If you're wondering what was so bad about the Sushi, I'll make it simple for you.  Looks and taste both scored a 3 out of 10.  Lack of knowledge of the Sushi from the employees should of been a red flag to us from the get go, instead we took a chance.  We love Benihanas, but never again at this location.  From our experience with Hibachi type establishments we've always encountered great personalities, great service, and tasty food that left us wanting to come back for that experience.  Instead we left with a sour taste in our mouths and with about $60 less in our pockets."

"Seems my review was filtered so I'll share my 2 cents again, this place is sad.  Awful service, awful food, and the lack of knowledge is a smack in a real Chef's face."
"The absolutely WORST hibachi experience I've every had in my life! It was my granddaughter's 4th birthday and thought she'd get a kick out of a hibachi chef. Fist we wait 45 mins or so to be seated. The restaurant wasn't even half full. We chose the dinner portion instead of the lunch because by this time we were very hungry and the waitress said we would get larger portions. She lied. Our hibachi chef was absolutely horrible! He spoke so softly that you couldn't hear anything he said. He barely spoke and didn't put on any kind of show at all! Our 4 year old was so bored that she wanted to leave. The other party that was seated with us all ordered the lunch versions and they got more food! The chef mixed everything together so no one got a larger portion than anyone else. The only thing that we got instead of them was a half a slice of zuccini and a little bit of onions. None of us even like onions. My ""steak"" was at least 1/4 fat which the chef cut off and disposed of which didn't even leave enough for a small sandwich. By the time our main course was served our vegetables and rice were ice cold. We asked to speak to the manager who told us that they weigh the portions in the back before they bring them out to cook them. However like I said the chicken was all mixed together and at least 1/4 of my steak was complete fat and thrown out. The manager didn't seem to care at all about our situation. We paid almost $10 a meal extra for the ""dinner"" portion. He could have easily knocked it down to the ""lunch"" price, but he refused. After all this, we over heard another chef complaining that the place had new owners and everyone quit.  I for one will never, EVER, go back there and would suggest everyone who reads this to stay away. We feel completely cheated."
"If it isn't broken please for the love of god leave it alone!! I have had the good fortune to eat at and experience some really fine restaurants around the country. So it may suprise some that locally two chains never failed to bring me back again and again. Benihana was one of them. Sometimes I ate there 4 or 5 times a month. Imagine my disappointment when twice I order my ""go to"" chicken and shrimp only to find shrimp is now colossal shrimp that had the consistency of shoe leather and mushrooms apparently don't apply. Service consisted of being scorned by an older Asian lady and told ""it will be a while"" to get my order corrected because they are busy! Then while I wait at the bar I ask about my favorite bartender I'm told oh they fired is ass! Truly more info than I needed! Especially from the new bartender with no personality that took forever (I was alone empty bar) to serve me my ten dollar gin and tonic. Looks like I'll be sampling one of the many Japanese steak houses not called benihana in the future. W h at a shame. How can someone take a restaurant that was so good and ruin it so fast? It really must take some effort. I just hate to see it. I used to love this place."
"Extremely disappointed, food was absolutely awful.  We sat at the bar and ordered from there.  Benihana special rice tasted like overcooked white rice with salt and chicken stock poured over it.  Our vegetables were so soft, they all tasted the same, mushy.  My sushi (Hamachi) had a 1.5"" x .5"" piece of underbelly still attached and was also inedible.  Our chicken was flavorless and rubbery.  To top it off our server was uncaring and disinterested.  This will be our last trip here as there are now much better options.  It's too bad a once gold standard restaurant is not any longer."
"Went for a friend's birthday and had the worst experience ever. We waited a while to order food once we received drinks. The waitress  wasn't very good at explaining the menu, we then sat and waited at least a half hour before a chef arrived -only to tell us that he was taking another table and we're getting a new chef...the chicken was chewy and undercooked, and 2 people at our table didn't receive what they ordered. When it was time for checks the waitress became standoff - ish with us telling us that someone needed to pay for the food that wasn't received because she has nothing to do with the chefs. We requested the manager and explained that our chicken was undercooked. He actually ate the chicken off of a plate and told us it was fine! !!! At the end of it all, the waitress didn't even know her managers name and was bashing him to our party. Very unprofessional.  I won't eat there again, and will be sure to advise others to do the same"
"We went to the Mad Mex in Cranberry Twp and won't make the mistake of going back. The food was horribly hot, like they just toss in heat for heat's sake, rather than for taste. I ordered the mole chicken enchiladas and that was NOT any kind of mole I've ever had. The sauce was more like a weak, thin ranchero sauce and both the sauce and the chicken was too hot. Even the guacamole was too hot. I recognize this restaurant chain is trying to be a trendy ""fusion"" of Tex-Mex and CA, but they failed. Luckily, they are in the same parking lot as a pharmacy so I was able to walk straight over for some Tums.If you want GOOD Tex-Mex, go to El Campo in Monaca or El Paso Mexican Grill in Chippewa. Both restaurants are excellent examples of good Tex-Mex, similar to the styles typically served in Central California."
This afternoon I took my 4 year old to this mad mex for lunch after a great morning swimming and doing a yoga class.  We had to send back our food because the chicken was stone cold (even though surrounded by sizzling veggies on a skillet).  It seemed like it was yesterday's chicken.  They brought out fresh food and I'm kicking myself for having eaten it.  The rest of our day has been spent cleaning up food poisoning accidents and in the bathroom.
"While I LOVE Mad Mex, this one is to be avoided.  For whatever reason, they always seem to manage to mess up orders and on a couple of occassions, I've just not felt well after eating there.  Because it's a BB, I just keep thinking I had to be wrong about that.  But after waking up in the middle of the night with all sorts of unpleasant stomach issues, I've had to write this location off.  Go to Robinson instead... (Or BB, please, please get a new KM for this location!)"
"Horrible service. I mean HORRIBLE. Went during a non-peak time. Pretty quiet in there, not a lot going on. Three employees who were sitting around chatting watched me and my my disabled, elderly friend stand and wait for long, endless minutes without doing anything. I finally went over to the bartender - also hanging out and chatting and watching us stand there - to ask if a hostess was available. Her response? ""Oh, I can seat you.""Really? Then why did I have to ask you to!?Then, the young male waiter assigned to our table just laughed when my companion asked where the restrooms are. WTF?Look, guys, that would be crummy service to anyone, but to treat an elderly person with a disability like that is just unconscionable. We left and won't be back."
"do yourself a favor and find another pizza location. I am a ten minute drive from this location. order was supposed to take an hour and fifteen minutes. when it was a half hour late I called and the manager said they called and were at my door. I've had no calls and was on my porch all day, only person who showed up was the mailman.the manager then called me back and said he believed his driver was lying and he was - as a courtesy to me - going to rewarm my two hour late pizza in the oven and send it over to me as soon as possible."
"Can you give a company zero stars?  This place makes you feel unwelcome and dumb.  The staff is judgmental and assigns you tasks solely based on their reaction to you.  Aka, assigning us the most mundane task and then taking it away and giving it to another couple because we weren't fast enough...We went on Valentines day, food tasted just OK..and the staff leading the group was HORRIBLE.  Not even remotely worth the cost if you will be treated like an imbecile."
Dirty and small.  Not laid out well.  Expired items on the shelves.  Rude cashiers.  Self check out usually broken.  Horrible experience more than once.  I don't shop here unless I have to.
"Store is too small and always crowded. Managers and workers are rude and condescending. Actually just had an awful experience with a manager named Chris. His attitude toward me made me feel putoff. It made me want to leave the store after. I have witnessed him being rude and condescending to other customers too. I just don't feel as though this store has hired workers with good customer service skills, especially this manager Chris."
"Obviously, you aren't coming here because it is in any way cool, or because of the 80's decor. You got kids with you or others whose palette doesn't extend past burgers and fries. These limitations can be overlooked. What can't be forgiven, however, is the shabbiness of this place. It looks like it gets vacuumed once a week, and the bathrooms are disgusting."
"Stopped for dinner there while traveling on business.  Greeted by a friendly hostess, seated and ignored.   After 25 minutes without a server, I left.  Will not recommend to anyone else passing through.  I don't know if all the wait staff didn't feel like serving one person because tips are smaller for one than a group or if they were just incompetent or just rude.  Extremely dissatisfied."
Went there on my first day in Pittsburg. Wasn't the best experience. My waitress was to busy talking to her coworkers that she couldn't even give us any sauces. The food was ok but nothing to great. When I go back to Pittsburg I will not be going there again!!!!
"Absolutely horrible service, when we entered the hostess gave an audible sigh like we were inconveniencing her with our presence.  We were seated for over 10 minutes and never had a server come to even take drink orders.  Needless to say we left, and we will not be going back."
"I wish I could give this NO STARS!! Heed my warning - I should of listened/viewed Yelp before going...I waited 5 minutes for a hostess to come and take my name, on a Sunday, at 5:30 to eat. This place was not packed. Why?? While waiting, I used the ladies restroom. Let me tell you... I've seen cleaner restrooms at a truck stop. Good gosh - it was disgusting. There were two stalls and one of them was disgusting, from what the other ladies were discussing while waiting for the I was in. There was paper all over the floors - really?? Doesn't anyone come and check this? So I go back out and we get seated. The area around us is gross, carpet is very dirty and not swept, dirty dishes on empty tables, and it looked very un-kept. Our waiter came up, I'll keep his name out of this, but he looked like he just woke up and rolled out of bed and came to work. He took our drink order and left. Came back and dropped them off and left again. Like really? your menu isn't that big! We got the pick three on the menu - comes with the tortilla soup, burger and fries and a cookie. The soup came out quick (the only good thing that happened) we finally got our food - I swear it took like 30 minutes. I got my burger and it was very pink in the middle, but had the waiter asked how I wanted my burger cooked, he would of known that I wanted it done and not pink. However, there was NO WAY I was sending it back. I didn't even eat all of it. I gave half of it to my husband to eat. The fries are very salty. NEVER did our waiter come and ask if the food was ok, how we are - nothing. RUDE! Then he comes by and says ""Your cookies will be right up"" - like ok? We don't get a choice of which ones we want? I guess not, so we get the cookies - they are outstanding, as always, but not worth the trip. This whole ""adventure"" took a hour and half. Others around us that didn't have our waiter seemed to have better service, so I am wondering if it was who waited on us? Either way, I am not going back to find out. How disappointing, because we recently moved here to Pittsburgh from Virginia where they took out our Max and Erma's - we loved it there, so we couldn't wait to go back to one - how quickly we found out not all are the same...."
"HIGH PRICES, HORRIBLE SERVICE!  Model Cleaners claimed $3 per shirt, but failed to tell me that certain materials (anything but cotton) will cost $4+!!  My total bill was more than double my regular bill at my regular dry cleaners. I only went here because I had a Groupon. Huge mistake. Absolutely stay away from any Model Cleaners. I can assure you both the service and the prices are SO much better at Red Cap Cleaners or any Runners Cleaners.  This place is a joke!"
"Absolutely awful service and the highest prices of any dry cleaner in or around the Pittsburgh area. Hidden fees upwards of $4.50 per shirt exist for any shirt that is not made of cotton! This wasn't made clear until I picked the shirts up from the Model Cleaners on Cochran Road in Greentree/Mt. Lebo area and received a bill upwards of $85 after expecting only a $30 charge.The older woman that worked the front counter at this location was extremely rude and short with me... absolutely horrible experience from beginning to end. STAY AWAY"
"A young child is the cashier who cannot explain the services as an older woman looks from the back and observes the confusion caused by the untrained employee.....first frustration-SHE DOES NOTHING TO HELP! The second is the lack of chairs in the front because you really need to sit down before asking how much the total bill will be.  I, as a customer, felt like I was bothering them by bringing them my business. More competition might change the way they conduct business. Employees bad attitudes combined with outrageous prices makes me wonder where the business sense is at. Off to Sams...."
"Model Cleaners failed to deliver 4 shirts and 2 suits in June.  I called the Manager Tim, and after many phone calls, said that his driver had a malfunction with the clothes in the truck and that my suits and shirts may have been delivered to the wrong location.  He said that he would contact those who might have them.  After a few phone calls later, no shirts, no suits.  Suddenly the suits and shirts appeared on my door.  I called them to find out, and they did not know they had been delivered.  So, I am assuming they were delivered by a neighbor.  I then took inventory of my suits and found that 4 suits are missing!   I called and left a message with no answer, and also left an email.... no answer to that either.    Today I received a call from Tim, (August25), and I just can't afford to lose any more suits.  I will be doing business elsewhere."
"They don't always do the work they say they've done!  I took my car there for an oil change and three weeks later the check engine light came on.  When I took it to the dealer they said there was very little oil in the car.  I had the dealer do an oil change and checked it a month later to make sure there isn't a leak.  There isn't, the car is fine so I'm convinced NTB never did the oil change.When I went back to NTB they kindly gave me a refund with no trouble, but offered no explanation or apology.  When it comes to cars I have to be able to trust the mechanic and the Greentree Rd  NTB has proven to be untrustworthy.  I obviously will not return."
"Made an appointment for an oil change, came in the next day was told there would be a 3 to 4 hour wait, Even after I  told the guy behind the counter I  made an appointment. They called me,( I gave them my number when I made the appointment)  I call them back, was put on hold 2x, finally just hung up. So incompetent I did not even get a chance to rate the actual service."
"I haven't been to Wendy's in some time now , but WOW What a disappointment .The people all look like they HATE their jobs and treat the customers accordingly. The food was horriable. The number one meal was down sized to the 99 cent cheeseburger and the fries tasted like they were sitting in grease that was a year old. The big coke was 3/4 ice and 1/8 water and 1/8 coke.I threw my mean in the garbage. I wont be back. If this is what Michael Obama wants us to eat ? Well lets see her and her kids eat it !WOW Dave , I bet your turning over in your grave , you poor bastered !"
Repeated my order 3 times and it still got screwed up. I had a feeling something was going to be off and sure enough....
Consumer alert... rats!
"I love Panera and there food, but this Panera ranks lowest of the low! Poor service, menu options not available, dirty utensils. I could go on..."
"Because I was pregnant, I've waited anxiously for 10 months to eat a Bacon Turkey Bravo sandwich. I ordered one today and received a sub par sandwich. Instead of the amazing tomato bread I got plain rye. Instead of my favorite Gouda cheese I received American. The most amazing thing is that there is literally no bacon on my bacon turkey bravo sandwich. Wtf? I really hope that this specific Panera Bread is to blame as I would hate to stop eating at this restaurant all together."
"The place looks like something from the Godfather - old school 1970 dark and gloomy wood paneling. Complete with crap brown pleather chairs and fake wood tables. The food was cooked well, but lackluster. I got veal picata which mostly had the flavor of flour and beef broth. On the plus, the staff was very nice and very attentive. Management - you really need to update the place."
A while back my Mom bought some donuts from here and they were really stale by the next day.  She called and mentioned something about it to them and they didn't even seem to care.  I like to try and support local business but with an attitude like they showed I have no use for them.  Doesn't seem to be any real set hours so you never know when they will be open.
"Darren's recent review of Kmart got me thinking about this place. I was out this way recently and I stopped to look for a place to eat. Man, talk about a dead mall! Parkway Center Mall even has its own listing on www.deadmalls.com I'd only been here once or twice back in its heyday. Back then it had Chi-Chi's (where thankfully I never ate. A hepatitis scare did them in), David Weis, Pharmor, CompUsa, Syms, etc were all here. Now the mall is mainly deserted. Only one floor is still open, and even that's got a vacancy rate of about 50%! Surprisingly what remains seems to be doing good business. Kmart is doing okay as is the Giant Eagle. Phantom of the Attic is alive and well and so is Pittsburgh Sports Deli. That's not an eatery either. It's a sports memorabilia store. There wasn't much reason for me for me to linger here though.  I soon left and went over to Olive Garden for lunch."
"What a depressing shell of a mall... I remember when it was *the* mall to go to... CompUSA, Pharmor, Kmart, Playless, Joann Fabrics, ChiChis, Giant Eagle... Hell, CompUSA, ChiChis and Pharmor don't even exist anymore... I'm not sure if Kmarts are still in business. Dead malls are sad, for some reason. Walking through this mall just creepy though."
"Truly the worst mall in America.  Going here is like being in a time machine though.  There is a store called ""90's Nails"" for goodness sakes.How is this place even still standing?  For one, I'm pretty sure it's built on an old mine or dig or something.  My mom has told me you can feel the ground move when you are here.  Yikes!The Sports Deli is actually a gem of a store though.  Man, the rent has to be so cheap!I got to give a shout out to Petland (I think that's what it is/was called) the pet store in this mall where we got our Maltese pup Sno-Flake 17 years ago!  What a great dog!  :)"
"Honestly I don't consider this place a mall. I consider it to be the entryway I have to use to get into K-Mart. Sadly there are a few stores left still lingering around but hey, I'm sure the rent is reasonable considering the land is falling apart. Calling it a mall is like calling me an athlete it simply isn't true. When you can lists off the name of the stores on your fingers and still have a few left over then you need to go somewhere else."
"Oy vey! Stay away, there's nothing here to see. Kmart, Phantom of the attic and a lottery place. This mall is dead! Deader than dead, dead dead!"
"Avoid at all costs!  They diluted my wine with water, the food was mushy, they charged me $3.25 for marinara sauce from A CAN (without informing us beforehand this injustice would be taking place)!  Typical big corporation: cut costs down to last nickel and inflate the prices so the CEO can fly in his private jet (after landing, eat at a REAL Italian restaurant) and purchase a new Bentley each year.  Visit DeBlasio's Restaurant for twice the portions; it is MUCH CHEAPER, as well.Worst experience at a restaurant... EVER!"
"Went to the Green Tree Olive Garden for their Buy One-Take One special.  Their Salads and breadsticks are the only real reason to go there anymore...!  All of their menu items are frozen, sitting in a freezer until you order them, then they're pulled out, microwaved and served.  I mean- if I wanted to eat microwaved food- I'd go to the freezer section of my grocery store and shop there.  Seriously- if you want good breadsticks & salad- go here... but that's the only reason.  I'd rather take the extra time & make real pasta at home, using my own sauce..."
"Rooms were clean and the amenities were fine. My problem is that the hotel double charged me for my stay. I reserved my room over the phone with the Holiday Inn hotline and was charged exactly what they quoted. When I get home to Virginia, I discover the hotel charged me again for the same stay, but I different amount. I only stayed one night and was charged twice. I was on the phone with 5 different people connected with Holiday Inn... NONE of them were of any help. They could either see one charge or the other (depending on who was looking); they told me to call back another time, when I am working; they insinuated I didn't know what I was talking about. All I want is to get an answer and none of these people can give an answer. This will be the last time I stay at any Holiday Inn.Add On: The WiFi is awful."
"This used to be the Holiday Inn and now it is the Clarion Hotel & Conference Center.  We needed to find a place not too far from Heinz Stadium for a reasonable price. We paid about $90 per night for this place, and the experience started poorly. We walked in and the two lobby TVs were tuned to Judge Judy (for the front desk employee's viewing pleasure). Employees watching reality TV during business hours really puts me off. It was hard to get the attention of the front desk staff because they were in the middle of a pizza order.  Two of the staff was working the front desk with a third suggesting toppings. It was pretty funny as one of clerks started to set up our room while another on the phone to the pizzeria kept interrupting the process with pizza questions. To the side the third clerk assisted with the pizza order. My wife pointed out her extreme cleavage, but I did not want to get lost there. We had a hard time understanding our clerk setting up the room. She tended to mumble, but did assert herself better when responding to pizza order questions. We finally got our room and headed up the very scary elevator to the 4th floor. In a way I felt as if we were at some sort of slum. I kept looking for gang tagging. The room was adequate (and I believe this was a renovated room), but a Motel 6 would be an upgrade. Whoever is doing the renovation has really poor taste and the quality of work is terrible. The swimming pool was a swamp (I am not kidding), but I am sure the frogs living in it were having a good time. The next morning we went down to the front desk again. This time the morning clerk was on a personal call and gave me an angry look because she felt that I was interrupting her call.  She did not even hang up; she just put the phone to her side, answered my question, and then continued her conversation. Personally, I think this hotel would be great for a horror movie and Hollywood should contact this place. It needs to be knocked down, or management should tighten up the staff and improve construction quality. If construction is on track (and I suspect something is wrong), get staff that really is gracious to customers. There are people that need jobs out there and I assure you with proper management they will do a great job. Don't stay here for over $45 per night (the price is due to the breakfast offered). Personally I would not stay here until they fix the place, but for some reason I don't feel that it will ever happen. Something just feels wrong. Perhaps Clarion has stopped the remodel due to the economy."
"Umm lol so seriously I read some reviews about this place and was like NOOOO it can't be that bad. HA HA....DUDE! So this spot is like mad cheap but REALLY? First we check in and notice the are undergoing some much needed renovations. Checkin was seamless as it should be. We get to out room #122 and after reading the reviews I know to check the beds immediately. The first bed legit has hair under the sheets...strike 1. As I'm pulling the covers back on the second bed I find two quarters...that's right folks! Obviously left by the last guest intentionally to warn the next occupants that the SHEETS HAVEN'T BEEN CHANGED...let alone checked. I mean really? You couldn't at lease have made it look like you did your jobs?We go to the desk and make them aware of the issue. They apologetically get us another room. This room is better its evident by the way these beds were made that the room has been cleaned. The elevator by the desk is stuck on the 3rd floor lol death trap so we take the stairs. Thank God for yelp....You've all been warned lol SERIOUSLY!"
"This was technically the Clarion hotel so I think the name is wrong on the page. I'd like to start by saying that I'm not much of a complainer, but if could have given 0 stars, I would have. So we are on our way up to room when we passed a vending machine with water underneath it. I assumed it was leaking and brushed it off. I don't care that much about little things like that especially since we were just sleeping there. After a great hockey game and a bar crawl, we came back to the hotel and got ready for bed. There was absolutely no hot water for my shower. So cold I wouldn't even consider hopping in really quick. It was late so I let it go and decided to try again in the morning. When I woke up it was the same thing. At this point I was fuming. I NEED a shower man!So I put on my angry pants and headed down the hall towards the elevator. Right in front of the elevator door there is a water fall pouring out of the ceiling from the third floor. ""What the hell...."" is pretty much what I was thinking at this point. Well there was my shower considering I had to walk through it to continue on my quest. As soon as the elevator doors open to the first floor, I see the hallway is flooded. The carpet is squishing beneath my feet all the way to the front desk where other angry people had beaten me to. Apparently a pipe had burst the day before and they had neglected to tell us that when we had checked in. I was so mad. I managed to get 70% off our bill and I made her call to check us in at another hotel. I would have insisted the whole bill be paid for but I'm really bad at being mean to people. All in all, I will never stay here or any other branch of this hotel again."
"Nightmare.  It's a ghost town. Needles in parking lot. ""Lobby"" is a hotel room with undesirables hanging around. Asked to see our rooms before checking in, given the key, room was filthy.  Saw a sticky note re: bedbugs.  Bolted, as fast as possible."
"I'm not sure I can even give this place one star. To be fair, the room we had was clean and comfortable. It did seem as if we had entered a time warp, though. Furnishings and bedding from the 70's...if not 60's! I've seen this place rated up to 3 stars on some websites. I'd like to know their qualifications!!When you first approach the hotel, it looks closed down. (And write obviously, it should be!!) You enter through a side entrance with hand written signs. The""office"" is a room right inside the doors. The hallway looks a wreck! (Oh yeah...they're under construction!!) Dirt, filth, and stains everywhere. Electrical wires exposed, smoke detectors hanging down. You look at all this and wonder how in the world are they passing codes?? (Or are they?!? Hmmmm)Like I said...the room was better..although not without faults. The lights over the bathroom sink did not work, and the shower did not work well. The tv was definitely a 1980's model. Wireless internet?? What a joke!! When we reported the bathroom issues, they said they would move us to another room. Since we were only staying 2 nights, we thought we would stay and just have maintenance look at it in the morning. We were informed maintenance would not be in tomorrow!! (Our ever??)We told the lady working the ""front desk"" that this hotel was pretty scary. Her reply was, "" yeah, we get that a lot!"""
"Ah, yes, what has yet to be said about this Clarion in Greentree, which is commonly known as the hotel of perpetual construction? Check the reviews folks (I sure wish I had) and you'll see that this place has been under construction for at least four years!My family, and I'm sure countless others, initially had trouble even finding the place and had to humble ourselves to ask directions at the nearby Doubletree Hotel. But even with directions, we drove right past the Clarion because: 1). There are no hotel signs; 2). We were arriving at night and the building was completely dark; 3). There were no parked cars visible from the road; and 4). The entire front of the building was boarded up.When we located the correct driveway and approached the construction zone, which once represented the entrance to the hotel, we saw a tiny sign directing us to the ""Temporary Lobby"" in the back of the hotel. The makeshift lobby consisted of a hotel room with a clerk sitting at a desk. The clerk initially could not locate our reservation on her computer, but found it as soon I had dug through my luggage to find a copy of the confirmation email.We were given a room on the second floor, thus we walked past stairwells that were closed (because of endlessly drying 'wet paint') and an out-of-order (and leaking) ice machine, until we located the elevator. Well, let me tell you folks, Disney's Tower of Terror ride is less frightening than this elevator. It looked like one of those service elevators that the public never sees. The floor was covered in dead bugs and the ceiling had holes in it, leading to the conclusion that someone must have taken the globes off the ceiling lights and just dumped the dead bugs onto the floor.When we got to our room, the carpet was so covered with nasty grease stains that we wanted to keep our shoes on. We did the preliminary check of the beds and found some stained sheets, but thankfully no bugs. We also checked for the free Wi-Fi signal and found that it was completely useless (maybe that's why the desk clerk couldn't locate our reservation).Finding the complimentary breakfast in the morning was like a scavenger hunt, where you look for clues on small paper signs in the hallways. The adventure actually took me outside of the hotel and then back into another part of the building (thankfully it wasn't raining like it had been all night). I then realized that I had just entered the main construction zone and the outside route must be the only passable route to the dining area.There was yet another sign outside the dining room which said something about Complementary Breakfast and the strange phrase ""Gratuity Included."" But inside the dining room there were at least two clearly-marked 'Tip Jars.' Now, I've been at some pretty trashy hotels in my travels, but I've never seen a tip jar in the dining room. I've also never been in a hotel dining room where it looked like a bomb had gone off, but there were drop cloths, power tools and all sorts of debris everywhere.When I got in line for the grub, I learned how the attendant earned her tips: she was there to help patrons identify the food. The person in front of me inquired about the gray-looking sausage-like links and was dutifully informed that they represented turkey sausage, adding, ""Because Clarion cares about your health."" I'm not kidding (who could make something like that up?). Anyway, I tried this so-called health food, because the only other hot alternative was French Toast and I did not want any syrupy food that morning. Guess what? The sausage had some kind of sugary additive to make the links taste like syrup! Real healthy, right? Thus, I ended up just getting a cup of coffee and returning to my room to pack up. The coffee was okay, by the way.In conclusion, I would not have stayed at the Greentree Clarion had I not made prior reservations and had not been coming back after midnight following a music festival where it rained all day. Plus, we used our loyalty points for this room, so I couldn't even request a discount.Believe me, HUD would shut this place down if it was an apartment building and the Dept. of Homeland Security would never even consider housing immigrants there. But, of course, you and I are welcome to pay upwards of a hundred bucks a night to stay there."
"This was by far the worst hotel experience I've ever had. It wasn't just that there was MASSIVE construction going on, but they did nothing to accommodate for it. They put us in a dirty floor with exposed ceilings, spackle, and sheetrock everywhere. The lights were broken and the room was filthy. The second room they out me in had an air conditioning unit that wouldn't reach the outlet, rendering it useless in the middle of the summer, had no toilet paper and water all over the bathroom floor. The CHILDREN working the front desk, which was located in a hotel room, gave the worst customer service, greeted me with an attitude, and couldn't manage to pull themselves away from their own conversation long enough to even check me in in a timely manner. The worst. Do not stay here."
"Wish I could give this place negative stars. Where to begin? It begins with no signs saying where the hotel is at. And then it goes into their ""temporary lobby"" which is a room turned into an office. The whole place is under construction which wouldn't be so bad, but my gosh they have crap EVERYWHERE!!! That leads us to the elevator. Norman bates would even say it's too creepy for him. It's marked with two different hotel names on top of that, holiday inn and ramada. Then the room. Not the worst of the worst, the decor is nice, the bed is as hard as a rock and the shower isn't even properly installed. Really wish I would have looked at yelp before booking here. Buyer beware. Oh yea! AND I knew they were under construction before we booked in June, and we were promised that the construction would be done before hand. Extremely disappointed."
"Don't even think about staying at this hotel. If the option of giving a zero were available, I would definitely use it. I travel for a living, have stayed in hotels being renovated before but this was the WORST experience I've ever had. Rude staff: front desk attendant was wrapped in a blanket, watching a move and had her feet propped up on the counter. She couldn't tear herself away from the movie to address me. Construction sure: this hotel had 2 full gas cans to the left of the front door, an empty case of beer and cans right beside that and over flowing trash cans as you walked in. Filthy would be a step up from the actual conditions. It hasn't been cleaned in months. It smelled of paint and chemicals.When I raised these concerns with the front desk clerk she said that there was no manager to meet with to discuss the conditions and that it was only the owner and he knew of the state of the place and didn't care. I made my reservation on Booking.com, called them immediately and sent photos to document the experience."
"I wish I didn't have to give even 1 star. Horrible service. I ordered family dinner for 4 plus 2 extra sides. I got sighs and eye rolls from the cook and the girl waiting on me. I got home and no extra sides. I paid for them but they didn't put them in the bag. I called and was told that they would send me a card for family dinner for 3 since they charged me for items not received. I called again on July 2nd as they never sent anything. I spoke with Autumn who advised me that she was a manager and would send out a gift card as previously promised. Still have not received. So if you choose this location make sure to check your order because they love to charge you for items you won't receive and have no follow through. I would be happy to get my 10.00 back. This started on June 24th. Terrible servce. We went there at least 1x a month and had no problem spending money, but I'd rather spend that 60.00 somewhere else. Mediocre food, horrible service, zero follow through. My advice, avoid this place."
"Junk worse than McDonald. My wife is a fan of this shop in Fairfax VA. Westopped for a quick breakfast. The poppers were stale bagels hard and the worst thing was when they heated the egg omlette in the microwave. For someone who does not use this at home, was a shock.. threw the stuff into the trash can.. the whole thing cost 25$..you decide if it was worth it"
Horrible experience again made sandwich wrong for 3rd visit. Will never be back. Ever
"Easter Sunday, 2015Store is open until 2:00. I arrive at 12:30. Employee is feverishly sweeping at carpet in front of counter in presence of customers seated and eating.  Dust is flying everywhere.  Customers' eyes are rolling.  I tell counter person. She asks employee to scale back. He refuses. Only two types of bagels are left even though the store is to remain open for another 1-1/2 hours. I get a cinnamon raisin bagel with strawberry cream cheese (it was good) and a medium coffee.  I go to get the vanilla hazelnut coffee and manage to get a half cup before the dispenser is entry.  I say something to clerk.  She tells me to get regular coffee and she will put hazelnut syrup in it.  WHAT???  She never offered to brew new coffee even though the store is to remain open for another 1-1/2 hour.   Never again will I go to this location."
It's sad. I used to get such great service at this location. Today both girls behind the counter were so rude and had zero personality. After waiting about 8 minutes for a bagel and a sandwich she yelled my order and basically threw the bag at me over the counter. I live right around the corner and will not go back there again. They may want to look into getting some new team members who value their job and understand the value of customer service.
Service is terrible. Waited for 15 minutes for a bagel with cream cheese with no line.
"Worst effin Starbucks on the block and their baristas suck at making drinks. Horrible customer service and they ALWAYS screw up our orders. I just don't understand why they're so lazy. I understand their comprehension level is low because of the lack of education though. But, if you hate your job, don't take it out on the loyal customers! Your life sucks, we get it, but you have ONE job at Starbucks, so do it right. It's not hard."
"Came here for a ""quick"" breakfast on our way from the hotel to Fallingwater, and regretted the decision immensely.Extremely long lines, and poorly trained staff. As a former employee, I know about staff roles and approximately how long it should take to receive your drink. This staff was not trained at all, and it was clear that they were overwhelmed with the crowd. It took me 32 minutes for me to receive my order (there were 7 customers in front of me), and my order was incorrect. I ordered a small coffee, medium latte, a croissant and a sausage breakfast sandwich. I know that the sausage sandwiches heat up for about 40 seconds in oven, so I can't comprehend why it took so long to get my order. Would never come here again. I also received a WARM cheese danish instead of my croissant. First, the warm, creamy colored goo in the middle is extremely unappetizing, and second, they looked so dejected when I pointed out that I ordered a croissant I almost just left.Do not recommend."
"I went to Princess Nails for a fill. The nail technician was a man- he was a complete @sshole. First, he grabbed my hand/arm across the table...there was, ""ma'am can you stretch your arm further across the table.."" it was just an abrupt, aggressive grab. Ok, I'm more than slightly annoyed @ this point...next, the guy asks me to pick a color, I tell him that I brought my own polish, which was a bright neon yellow color. The guy says how much he hates the color yellow...ok, who asked your opinion? And proceeds to tell me how much he hates polishing nails w/ yellow...continues to be aggressive and rude...I'm pissed @ this point...final point? Stay far away from this spot...there is another nail shop right next door, they were crazy busy...but never again will I EVER go to Princess Nails...they have shitty techs, shitty color choices, and the entire environment is small and dirty...& btw the eyebrow tech's skills are HIGHLY overrated."
"I should've believed what was already written but It was close to my hotel. The WORST mani/pedi of my life. I'm 43. I'm a flight attendant. I've been to a LOT of nail salons. I swear she wasn't licensed. She had no clue but claims to have been doing nails for 40 years. She clearly needs to retire and the male owner was an a$$. He says ""not everyone does it the same."" Well..... They certainly should come close!! No cuticle push back. Didn't know how to remove gel polish. Didn't file straight or smooth. Didn't clean under my nails after lotion. I had to tell her to take alcohol to my nails to clean off lotion and remind her to use a base coat. Then she polished all over my cuticle. 17 hours later having done nothing but sleep workout and shower the polish is chipped off 6 nails."
"I guess this will be my last good review for Princess nails. Unfortunately the worst possible thing has happened. I have one eyebrow! Its slowly growing back but the idea of having to pencil in my eyebrow everyday is starting to get to me. Unfortunately I don't know what happened? Michelle are you going blind? Are you okay? Obviously you left me with completely a mishapen eyebrows which I had to have someone else fix because you botched mine. I cried, I weeped, i found myself in the fetal position. I'm no longer going back. I know some people have off days but this was BAD."
"The WORST nail place I have ever gone to. There was no message when doing my pedicure, they didnt clip my toe nails and barley filed them. Same for my finger nails. There was still dirt under my nails, they were not clipped or shaped. The atmosphere is gross and unsanitary. The worst was withing a minute of walking out the door an ENTIRE nail fell off ( was just paint, no acrylics or anything) I would have gone back to fix it but It had already taked 2 hours just to get those done. Within the hour I lost 3 full nails. The paint didnt stick at all. It was blobby and bad looking. There was paint all over the sides of my nails. AWFUL place. Very bad expierience. Not to mention the prices are jacked up as high as they can make them."
"By far the worst Shellac manicure I have ever had. I went down on my lunch break for a quick mani. First the woman rushed through my ""manicure."" I'm not sure they have any type of sanitizer for their instruments as she kept pulling things out of her drawer. The manicure was very quick and not at all thorough. Once she started to paint my nails she kept having to fix them because she was in a such a rush. She took off polish that was on the nail and then pushed my hand into the UV dryer. When she went to put the top coat on my Shellac she put the Foundation coat on 2 of my nails before she realized and wouldn't fix them saying they will be fine. During the entire process she did about 6 eyebrow waxes and then would forget where she was in my process. She also kept forgetting to turn on the UV dryer to the point where she walked away and I had to turn it on.Do not go here. If I could give it 0 stars I would."
"Went in to get my gel nails taken off and they straight up just told me no. NO? Fine, that's money out of their pocket and I will never set foot in that diseased infested looking store."
"DO NOT GO HERE. WAS ALMOST ELECTROCUTED.It's 2015. I have a smart phone. I have the Yelp app. I really should have known better to walk in here. I should have known to walk out when I actually did walk in there. It's the size of a closet, completely messy, and disorganized. But you know how some dive bars have charm? I was thinking this place might be like that. NO.I sat down in the chair for pedicure. Bin filled to the brim with soap suds. That's not how it's done in Philly. I never get sudsy water. Woman takes off my toe nail polish. She gets up and plugs in a nail buffer a foot away from the bin of water and was about to take my foot out of the water to buff my toe nails. OUTLET. SOCKET. BIN OF WATER. I immediately told her not to. She said it was fine. I said absolutely not.Her next move was to take tools out of a janky, old plastic box. UNSTERILIZED. I asked, ""Are those sterilized?"" She said quickly, ""ok, ok, for you I will sterilize."" FOR ME? Shouldn't you be doing this for all of your clients? I got up and left with soap suds all over my nails. Went to Salon Nuvo instead and had an infinitely better experience. Health department should definitely check in on Princess Nails. Shady and terribly run nail salon. Surprised someone hasn't been hurt yet."
"I got a good haircut here a few months ago, so this one-star review is not intended for the stylists.  It is a response to a strict no-returns policy on salon products, which makes me pretty mad: I couldn't have known they recommended the wrong product without trying it, and now that I tried it, they won't refund my purchase.  Catch-22.  I came in to buy a replacement for my normal bumble and bumble curl creme for thick hair, and was told by the receptionist that bumble and bumble's ""defining creme for fine curls"" is the new packaging of that product (which seemed weird to begin with...thick hair..fine curls...) Nope, it's totally different and it doesn't work for me.  I used it twice, figured that out, and now I'm stuck with an expensive product I can't use. I called bumble and bumble and they told me that the product I use has been discontinued.  All my previous salons in other cities would have honored a return in this situation.  I won't be back to MCN."
"Today, I definitely didn't have a great experience at MCN. I got my haircut couple months ago from there and I liked it, so I decided to go again for coloring today.I wasn't happy about it at all -cuz I can still see the line btw my root and the bottom. PLUS, they charged me 25 bucks more for the blow-dry without telling me. I wish I didnt go there for the color.."
"I'm not sure if I will return to MCN salon. However, the haircut I received was not the source of my disappointment and annoyance with MCN. Upon my arrival, I was offered coffee by my stylist prepared just as I pleased. I was instructed to leave my belongings in the coat room and put on a robe. In doing so, I left my coffee on the side of the counter at the front of the salon. I was quickly ushered to the back for my shampoo, condition, and Kerastase treatment. I realized I forgot my cup and went back to the front to retrieve it. As I politely ask the woman behind the desk if she saw it, she cuts me off mid sentence to inform me that she has thrown it away and gives me a sneer. As I look at her in bewilderment as to how to handle her rudeness she rolls her eyes and asks if I still want something to drink. UM, YES? That's why I'm looking for my cup now. She then instructs me that I'm not to wait for her to finish making the drink and that she will deliver it to my chair. Yeah, no. Never did that. But she did take the time to come over to my stylist, glare at me, and inform my stylist that the next client was here. Rude. I thanked my stylist for her time and pay for my cut and style. Only then did I realize that my friend should have also received a free Kerastase treatment because of MCN's birthday special. They charged her the standard, $30. Well, the woman  behind the counter basically told me that she needed to see proof that the email offer existed. Why didn't I have to show some email to get the free treatment? She was basically giving my Asian friend a terribly difficult time. Between me and my friends, we have spent over $1,000 at your salon and you are going to treat loyal clients as so? I also believe that this salon desperately needs a dress code enforced for all staff. If you go to MCN, take a look around, you will agree with me. Finally, leave your pooches at home. I don't particularly like the large dog that roams around and slobers on the leg of my pants during my appointment. 1 star, but thank you to my stylist for a great cut. 5 stars for you."
"I have been sitting here looking at the poor quality of my shellac manicure and I just had to write. I walked in to Kenny's nail salon this afternoon and was pleased that there wasn't a wait. They also provided very friendly customer service.However, my manicure looks terrible! It looks like I painted my nails myself, only even I could do better. The paint and clear gel is all over the underside of my nails and baked on, no less. I'm even finding paint on my fingers now. The nail technician, a female, didn't even touch my cuticles, but she did use an electric file to shave down the nail bed. I guess that's supposed to count for the cuticles? No frills, no hand massage, not even any moisturizer or cuticle oil or anything.I am horrified I was charged $25 and then I even tipped 20%. Now I'm wishing I would have asked them to start over, perhaps with a different nail technician. I won't be going back, however. At least I was in and out in 25 minutes. But what a terrible job."
Very sloppy! No attention the polish is all over my fingers so disappointing and aggravating that now I'm going to have to pay more money else where to get them redone
"I would put 0 star if it was possible!!! The worse manicure in my life !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I decided to try salon todayI ask for a manicure and Chinese man shrieks at me: WHAT COLOR YOU WANT!!!!! He has long, gross fingernails with dirt underneathHe picks out said dirt WHILE massaging my hands with some oil stuff. he painted my nails and when he was done I looked down in horror. It looked like a child had done it. The bottom was so sloppy I had nail polish on my skin of my fingers and it just looked horribly unprofessional. I had to be somewhere right after my appointment after I said to him that's is not a good job he just grab my hand and pure polish remover on my finger and start screaming in Chinese language. I was in shock. This guy is out of control its definitely something wrong with him. He can't be around people . People BE WARE DO NOT GO THERE !!!!!!"

"Visiting downtown Pittsburgh for a wedding so I scheduled an appointment for myself and two friends for mani/pedis.  The first strike was that when I made an appointment for three people at the same time, they did not let me know that only 2 nail techs were available so me and my friends were not able to have our nails done at the same time (looked like they only had 3 total and one spent his time watching a movie on his iPad while he took care of another customer).  Also a heads up - only 3 pedicure chairs in the place.  The pedicure was the shortest I have ever received, they spent barely any time massaging or rubbing.  The nail tech also sent me to the manicure chair without painting my toe nails and told me she would do them later.  She later had me put my feet in her lap and she painted my toenails in the manicure chair.  During my manicure, the nail tech made two of my fingers bleed while she was trimming my cuticles.  Not only did she not apologize, she lectured me on how I should be taking better care of my cuticles...my nails are in great shape and even if they were not, you just made me bleed!!  Two days later I still have sore fingers.  Very limited color selection. Definitely not worth $40."
"My food was plain and boring. Our service was sub-par; we asked for water when we first got there and it didn't show up until shortly before we got our check. The dumb ass waitress spilled water on the floor by our table but didn't bother cleaning it up so when one of the older ladies that was joining me got up she slipped and fell. The manager on duty did apologize, but that was it. There was no offer of a comp or anything and she basically turned around and went on about her business despite us pointing out to her that there was water on the floor that caused the fall. Fortunately no one was seriously injured, but I really don't think that the staff handled the situation with any sort of intelligence or empathy. The place was noisy and it was pricey."
"I'm staying at the hotel at which the soho is located and I thought it would be a convenient place to eat dinner. Well, it was overpriced and the food was terrible. I ordered the chicken parm pasta and got it to go to my room. The pasta looked and tasted like it was days old and soggy, the chicken was overdone (dry), and the tiny (super tiny) roll was dry and stale. Very bad food and overpriced. Not only was the food a huge disappointment but the bartender who took my order was unfriendly and not helpful. She then began to pour beer from the tap into a glass and sprayed beer on me and didn't say a word, though I met eye contact with her as soon as it happened. She was more interested in talking with the other waitresses.......you know she got a great tip :)Try another place for food even if you have to step outside of the hotel, there are a bunch of places to eat across the street and at the baseball stadium that is right next to the hotel....Atrias was pretty good and very nice wait staff. http://www.atrias.com/"
"I wish i could give this place no stars! we sat for lunch after a lunch rush there were 2 other table in the restaurant besides ours, we ordered a blt with chili and a cesar salad....1 hour latler a stale BLT and chili that looked like it had been sitting there for 2 hours comes out. I was still waiting for my cesar salad. The chili was cold and the blt bread was so hard you couldnt bite into it. When we asked to speak to the manager the waitress got very defensive... the manager came over and explained that is their food and how its made so he wasnt sure of the problem. After an argument going back and forth ensued he agreed to comp the meals. Here is the kicker haha...we were going to leave the waitress a tip because clearly it was not her fault however, she came over and asked if our problem was resolved we said yes and then she rolled her eyes and walked away. No tip for you my friend. This is not how you do business especially when there are other options BESIDES SOHO to choose from for lunch."
Nice looking place and the worst service i've had in the last 20 years.   After waiting 10 minutes to have a bartender at a less than half full bar acknowledge us we then ordered and the drinks arrived.  Hope you only need one round because after waiting 30 minutes to try to order a second round we paid with exact change to save us from wasting another hours of our life.   It is hard to explain how oblivious the bar tenders were.
"No redeeming qualities here. Schwill on tap. Food was terrible - had the pizza, mac & cheese bites, and spinach & artichoke dip.  It was hardly edible. Stay away."
"Stayed at the Springhill Suites for 3 days, for Pirates games. They wouldn't let us eat inside with a 12 yr old (at 7PM, and when we walked through the restaurant to get back to our room, there were many children running around). So we ate outside. Service  was lousy- Molly didn't make eye contact, and acted like it was a pain to serve us. Food was crappy- we got potstickers and firecracker shrimp, kid got the chicken fingers. Food was fried, which was expected, but it looked and tasted like frozen food. Very salty, batter was not tasty. Sauces were  borderline tasteless. Would never go back, and would not recommend this place."
"Stayed @ the hotel. Ordered sirloin steaks. No steak knife, no mashed potatoes, no asparagus as ordered. So, Check your order. I mean for a 2 person $50 meal with tip I would hope the waitstaff would deliver on what was ordered & asked before we left. But skip the 20%, $10 room service fee & http://www.sohopittsburgh.com. walk downstairs."
"Menu in the room said ""1/2 price apps 5-7pm everyday"" menu in the elevator said ""1/2 price apps 5-7pm everyday"" menu at the restaurant read ""1/2 price apps 5-7pm everyday"" everyday mind you on all of the menus. Guess what not when there is a game I was told. What does that mean? Pirates, Steelers, Penguins etc? What day is there not a game? What a joke. THEY DO NOT HAVE 1/2 PRICE APPS!!!! Somewhat slow service and somewhat overpriced. $13 burgers, $4 domestic bottles. Look elsewhere there is a lot surrounding this place so you have options."
"I got a cobb salad, prior to pirate game, almost no lettuce, chicken had to be frozen and microwaved warm....daughter got buffalo chicken wrap tasted poor, not even my 14 year son would eat it. (He eats anything)"
"If you're dying for the recipe for their ""Buffalo Macaroni and Cheese"" than look no further! It was definitely some sort of boxed Mac & Cheese, with a chicken tender covered in Frank's Red Hot on top.  I have much higher expectations for food in a city that offers so many delicious options; I could have gotten an incredible mac & cheese at Meat and Potatoes for less money!"
"So when I walked in to Soho last month for happy hour, a person in my party made a casual comment that this place never seems that busy when they walk by it. Little did we know that our group would discover exactly why this is the case during our visit. It's especially noteworthy that I came with a large group that made a reservation with specific instructions about what we wanted. Our evening plans had been made well in advance, and Soho knew - or should have known - exactly how many people would be in our party, and when we would arrive. Most of all, they should have known we had not only asked for a table to be ready, we had asked for water and very specific appetizers to be ready for our group, as we would be hungry after the event we enjoyed before the happy hour. Well, as you can probably guess from my rating, making a reservation and discussing and confirming our needs with the staff well in advance made absolutely no difference in the quality of our visit. In fact, I can summarize my entire visit here in two words: we waited.We waited for them to confirm we had a table after we walked in at 7:15. We waited for the sever to come after they finally confirmed that yes, a reservation had been made. We waited for the server yet again after asking for drink menus. We waited for these drinks, and for water. And we waited for our pre-ordered appetizers. Absolutely nothing arrived in a timely manner. In the 35 minutes that I waited with the group, all I got was a water. None of the pre-ordered appetizers even arrived while I was there, and many people waited 10 to 15 minutes for their other drinks. I was honestly astounded at how much the staff missed the mark with our reservations and requests. So I gave up, and left at 7:50 to find a better venue that was interested in providing me with a relaxing Friday night meal.And all of that was on a night where the place was mostly empty! I can't even imagine what the service must be like if it's actually busy - and I certainly won't be back to find out!"
Terrible. Been sitting at the bar for 15 minutes. Yet to be even looked at by a bartender. Terrible. Not even busy. Not recommended at all!!! Terrible service. Or lack there of.
"For a place that has a $75 entree I was pretty shocked to see a $2 charge for blue cheese olives on my bill... pretty tacky.   That was definitely a first.  I was disappointed the waitress didn't say anything either. Aside from that the service was pretty good... and the sashimi was a great value.  But everything else about this place is shwag.  The seared tuna - garbage, rainbow roll and Caesar salad - weak,  and the sides incredibly small.  The place has the feel of a riverboat buffet.  If this was stand alone they would only get away with charging 40% of what they are now... in the Westin.I would skip it, or if you have to, get sashimi at the bar and make sure you review your bill."
"Having read positive things about OFM lately, I thought we'd give it another try as it's been years since we've eaten there.  Unfortunately, our experience was dreadful.I knew going in that the food was overpriced.  Always has been.  But not only can you get less expensive fish/seafood elsewhere, but you also can get FRESHER food at other places.  Our food tasted frozen and overcooked.  What has NOT changed is the extremely poor service.  If you don't look wealthy or if you're not buying multiples rounds of alcohol, the wait staff avoids you.  And that was our experience the other night.  How can restaurants get away with poor service and bland food at such high prices?  I guess OFM lives off the travelers and not the locals."
"Hotel restaurants are just awful!  It's like you have to be mediocre to have a restaurant inside a hotel.  I don't get it!  Wouldn't they WANT you to stay and spend money on their property?? Nevertheless, this place in the Westin hotel is no different.  For starters, the place is sorely outdated.  The decorations look like they're straight out of an 80's music video.  I went with my mom, who asked me if the glass sculptures on the ceiling where Chihuly's.  I almost choked on my bread when she asked! I always go for sushi when it's on the menu at a fish place.  I can't get away from it, plus I need my weekly (or sometimes daily) fill of it!  So I ordered a spicy yellow tail roll and a ginger salad.  The spicy yellow tail was not spicy.  It had a side of ""spicy"" sauce.  I'm not too sure that qualifies it to be spicy with a dab of sauce.  The salad's ginger dressing was awful and watery.  I love ginger dressing when it's done right.  But it was not happening at this place! The thing that really made me mad is that the place is overpriced to begin with.  My tiny yellow tail roll was more expensive ($7) than the fabu Penn Ave Fish Co ($5.50) rolls.  And DEF not as good!  My mom ordered a bowl of fish soup.  This ""bowl"" was a deep dish salad bowl and looked as if there was a small ladle size serving.  It was hardly halfway full.  That's all my mom had ordered for lunch.  It was pretty sad looking.  So she asked for a little more from the server.  The server said that's all she could give her because it was restaurant policy.  Now let me tell you....I've worked at restaurants.  I've witnessed the people who eat their ENTIRE meal, then say it was bad and want another one...and they get another one!  Now that's messed up!  Asking for a little more soup, that's supposed to be a BOWL but looks more like a spoonful is hardly too much to ask for. Needless to say, I will NOT be back. There are WAY better fish places in the city to fill my belly with, hands down! Go to Penn Ave Fish Co, It's opened a new location right on Fifth Ave! Don't say I didn't warn you!"
"Terrible.I visited this restaurant for the first time yesterday to use up a Groupon.  Thank God I didn't pay full price for this slop.  First, lets talk about the decor.  Others have commented about the outdated 80s look of the place. I concur.  The chairs are ridiculously heavy and uncomfortable.  And don't even get me started on the hideous glass constructions hanging from the ceiling.  Second, let talk about the staff.  Unprofessional to say the least.  When we were waiting for our table, I witnessed the hostess yell at a man from across the restaurant, instead of walking up to him and guiding him to his party.  ""Hey Anthony, your party's over here!""  Ridiculous. This restaurant has an open kitchen, which is usually a good thing - but not when everyone's yelling at each other.  We were seated near the kitchen and, I'm not exaggerating, heard someone yell ""order!"" approximately every 30 seconds.  Staff yelled at each other from across the restaurant constantly.  I felt like I was on a playground.  Our waitress was a nice, sweet girl, and she did the best she could considering the environment she was in.  I have no complaints about her.  The food, though... Jesus.  We started with the ""margarita shrimp cocktail"".  Imagine tiny round pieces of popcorn shrimp floating in a glass of lime flavored water.  These were served with tortilla chips, which you'd think were meant to be used to scoop up the shrimp from the glass.  But, the shrimp are solid round balls, not a scoopable salsa.  We tried picking up the shrimp with the chips, but they'd just roll off and end up on the floor.  My date and I just laughed as we TRIED to eat this concoction.  When it finally made it into our mouths, it was gross anyway.  My boyfriend ordered a sushi/sashimi combo platter.  I'm being generous by giving it a rating of mediocre.  Take out sushi from a grocery store is better.  Now, I admit, I made the mistake here - I ordered the fried fish platter.  I'm used to getting a variety at seafood restaurants.  At a place like Mitchell's Fish Market, you can get a dish with a piece of fish, a few scallops, a few shrimp, and a vegetable.  The Original Fish Market has no such dish.  The only dish I could get that had more than just one piece of fish with some plain steamed white rice and steamed spinach, was the fried fish platter.  So, I ordered that, with a side of green beans (vegetables were $5 - $7 extra).The description said I would get a piece of tilapia, scallops, oysters, shrimp, and french fries.  I didn't realize this meant that the tilapia was fried, the scallops were fried, the oysters were fried, and the shrimp was fried, all on top of a giant bed of fried french fries.  It's just not what I pictured.  Like I said, it was my mistake for not reading carefully and not asking the waitress, but lets say for argument's sake that this is what I wanted.  It was still disgusting.  The batter/flavor was exactly the same for everything.  The scallops tasted like the french fries.  The shrimp tasted like the french fries, the tilapia tasted like the french fries.  I didn't even try the oysters, but I'm pretty sure they would have tasted like french fries.  I ate barely a quarter of this dish, and I'm pretty sure I consumed an entire week's worth of saturated fat.  If you ate this entire plate, I think a heart attack would interrupt your dessert.The green beans were good. Other people commented that you can't count on hotel restaurants being worthwhile.  I have to agree.  If everyone's just passing through, you don't have to worry about actually impressing anyone and getting them to come back.  And with business travelers, they're usually paying with their company's dime, so they don't bother to complain or expect much.I have learned my lesson.  I'm not coming back.  And I seriously question the sanity of people who gave this place more than two stars."
"100 dollars for 2 people.  2 small cups of lukewarm soup, 1 tuna sushimi, 2 waters and 1 seafood pasta, 1 salmon.  It all had no taste!"
"I have never had such awful, inedible food at such an appallingly ridiculous price. It's not only a failure in execution, the plates are very poorly put together, and the flavors of the sides and sauces with the protein do not marry well at all. I was severely disappointed by plating, and then just got mad when I started eating.You would think for 44$ your steak would at least be properly cooked. What was supposed to be medium, came raw. The steak was tough and tasteless. Ahi tuna, asked rare, was overcooked; also bland, even with the sauce. The oshinko side was laughable. Seriously. I laughed.  pasta was overcooked, and by the time it got to us, the sauce was laminated with coagulating fat. The sushi was an amatuer attempt at best.  There was too much rice, and presentation was sad. Ambience is tacky. Ugly 80s-reminiscent wallpaper covers half the room and framed sketches of fish plaster the other half.Service was the only redeeming quality. To put it in perspective, my neighborhood Houlihans seems gourmet next to this place."
"We were staying at the Westin and it was late and the Original Fish Market was right on site. Well the experience at both the hotel and the restaurant was dismal. We waited too long to be seated and the hosted seemed to have attitude when we asked one of the servers to find her. A simple ""Sorry for the wait"" would have been nice. We were about to leave after waiting 15 mins for a waiter. Unfortunately we did not.  The food was all bland and tasteless. Oh! Except for the bold taste of Obay on the fries. I had blackened rainbow trout.  I expected a bold favors but yet nothing. It was not even blackened.  Looked like paprika for color, but that was it.  Mash potatoes were dry and tasted gritty like it came from a box. We skipped dessert for obvious reasons. I am not adverse to paying top dollar for a great meal. I hate paying top dollar for a lousy meal that I could have done better myself.Do yourself a favor and avoid the Original Fish Market.  I was generous to give one star."
"Terrible crab bisque. My husband liked the fish stew though.  It had lots of beans, was thick and chili-like. The rest of the lunch was so unnoteworthy, I can't remember what I ordered, though almost all of it was still on the plate at the end of lunch.  I do remember the bad taste in my mouth for the rest of the day."
"Literally the worst restaurant experience that I've ever had, including McDonald's and 24-hour scarf-and-barf diners.Pittsburgh is undergoing a bit of a food renaissance, yet the Original Fish Market continues to put out an inferior product in a horrendous atmosphere at an obscene price.  Our fish was tasteless and rubbery, my white wine came out at room temperature, the restaurant was extremely dirty, and our server was clearly apathetic.  The Original Fish Market opened in 1998, and quickly found a place in the market in a city where Red Lobster was still considered ""good seafood"".  As top-notch restaurants entered the market, the local palates grew up in a big way.  The Original Fish Market seems content to remain frozen in time competing as a mediocre option in an under served market space.  Unfortunately for them, their market space is now flooded with options offering a far superior product  at a fraction of the price."
I went for lunch last week.  The food was awful.  Do not waste your money at this restaurant.
"This place used to have decent fresh fish for lunch and the only wild salmon for lunch in the city, but the new chef and the new menu for lunch are horrible.  One of the crazy dishes of fish was on a bed of some type of cold pasta and while the fish was good the cold pasta was soooo bad I spit it out and just ate bread and fish.   Also, the new menu focuses on non-fish dishes.  Why?  This is a fish restaurant so 75% of the menu should be fish!  Also, the menu changes now every day so you can't go in and get a favorite dish.  If you want fish they have some new screwy fish dish that changes almost everyday or certainly every week.  The fish dishes were so bad I switched to a fish salad but they were not great either.  I had eaten at this restaurant for lunch at least once a week for over a year getting some type of fish with rice and spinach which I loved and was so good but new chef and especially the new menu I will never go back again."
"Seriously, terrible.  Just all around terrible.We've been to the OFM twice now... the first visit was acceptable, but the second was absolutely terrible.  We had late reservations for a quick bite after a lovely night at the O'Reilly to celebrate my husband's birthday.  As sushi lovers, we thought this would be a great way to end the celebration.  We sat at the sushi bar and couldn't get the attention of our waitress or the sushi chef.  After an exhausting 20+ min wait in our seats and just as I was about to go find someone, we finally were able to place our order.  Again... waiting, waiting.  Oh, our wait was enhanced by guests of the hotel (tweens loaded with makeup from what appeared to be dance competition and their drunk parents) standing behind us. No, they were not eating, they were just standing there... yelling, at 11pm.  Our server returned to bring my husband's glass of warm white wine and commented on how terrible our experience must be, but did nothing to help... no drink refills, no offer to call the manager, nothing.   Hubby sent the 14$ glass of bath water, I mean, wine, back to the bar, only to have it replaced with, you guessed it! another glass of warm white wine.  Our sushi was finally ready and it was edible but not enjoyable...  no flavor in the fish and hard rice.  We left before finishing our 40$ meal (1 glass of wine, 1 water, 1 roll, 2 orders of sashimi).  I almost asked for the manager, but frankly was tired of waiting and just wanted to get out of there.  To top it off, we paid $12 for valet parking that would not be validated unless we spent $50 at the restaurant.  We will not give it another chance and suggest you don't give it a first."
"This place really should be much higher quality for first the prices and second the only food option at the Westin.  I stopped by here two nights ago on a work trip to grab some food.  The wine that I ordered was out (which was fine) and substituted - but for a place with a giant wine cellar I wouldn't suspect that should be an issue for the glass wines.When I went to order I asked the server how the scallops were - and asked her to be honest.  She said that they are the most well done in Pittsburgh.  Well I think she meant that literally because the scallops were as tough as a tire and there presentation was poor with a pile of over salty spinach and some kinds of blobs smeared around the plate.  I was a little bummed about my experience when the 55 dollar bill came for one entree and a glass of wine.Also a one off thing but the overhead light on the table was like a 10K watt surgical spotlight.  It actually hurt my eyes to look at the table it was so bright.  That should be an easy adjustment for the management.  Food quality on the other hand - you need a new chef."
"DIDN'T EAT HERE...this review not about the food.  We went on Friday night around 8pm, there seemed to be about 25% occupancy.  The hostess asked us if we had a reservation, we didn't , and she told us that they were somewhat behind and that we would have to wait 20-30 minutes.  WTF?  We IMMEDIATELY left and frankly its not worth going back again.  shame, the fish was good there. Crappy hostess for sure."
Stopped in for lunch. No greeter so we weren't sure where to go. Super expensive for the portions. My salad had dressing only in the center. The rest was dry. My sweet potato fries that came with breaded shrimp tasted BBQ-ish  weird. But the worst was that my breaded shrimp actually had a curly hair cooked into the bread ing. It was disgusting. The waitress apologized and offered to replace but my appetitive was gone by then. She however did not offer to comp the meal. I would absolutely not return nor recommend it to anyone. Way too overpriced and the hair was a disgusting unwanted bonus :-(
"Not good. I suspect the servers are over worked or spread too thin b/c the service sucked. The food was ok, but nothing special. It's a shame b/c better service would have made the experience decent."
"Never been before and went on a Thursday night at 6PM before a show. Upon arriving, all the good seating near the windows was blocked off for private use (and remained unused). The ""host"" told us to go find our own seating wherever we wanted. The setup is interesting with a large open bar area and a small number of tables around the perimeter. We took a seat at a table. The bar seating was fairly full with some milling around in the area and standing, and probably a total of 30 people there. We saw at least 5-6 staff, a couple sitting around playing on their phones.We sat at our table for 20 minutes and never had a single person come by, not to say we will be there shortly, not to take a drink order, nothing. We could tell this wasn't going to be good so left and no one even noticed.It was a little more bar than restaurant, so we weren't sad to leave."
"I never ate here nor could have possibly gotten a drink no one would wait on me.My friend who wanted to be a socialite of some kind asked me to come with her. I don't know what she was thinking. Not my scene whatsoever! We had come from a free Devo concert. I was dressed in converses,  a side pony tale, and bright pink 80's garb. I have never seen so many idiots occupying one space. The chicks looked at me like I was an alien. Not everyone needs to wear 5 inch heels, gobs of makeup, and clothes that is so tight that your breathing is impaired just to get a little cleavage popping out of a minuscule ugly dress. I like fashion, I love heals. It was the glassy, vapid, duplicates that I saw that made me give my friends a hug and kiss then seriously BOLT out the door! Super bad energy in this place. I jumped in the first cab I saw and headed to Lawrenceville. I didn't even say goodbye to the friend who had brought me there. Smoke bomb disappeared! She knew I would hate it but just didn't want to go alone. I was pissed.The night was not lost. My awesome ""fiends"" from LA (stunt man Curtze, and Elvis impersonator slash gangster screen writer) met me out and we dive bar-ed the rest of the evening away. I meant to write ""friends"" but didn't change it because fiends, haha... much more appropriate. I am not saying that people who like this place are any particular sort. Some of my favorite people like Bossa Nova. Just stating my personal experience."
"Extremely disappointed.    My wife and I walked into the restaurant to have the hostess tell us that is was open seating.   Okay, that's fine..... as we walk to find our table I'm wondering 'why don't the just have a sign there because she wasn't  very friendly, nor timely with the direction.'    That said, we sat down at a table set up for dining that was nicely presented.   Unfortunately we sat at the table for approximately five minutes without recognition from any employee at the restaurant.   At this point, we decided to dine elsewhere.   As we walked out, there was still not one bit of attention given, again.   The hostess never lifted her head from whatever she was reading.   I think that a sign would have served a much better purpose.   On the back side it could have said ""thanks for your business"" .....or lack, there of."
"The menu was small and underwhelming. The flatbread pizza most likely came out of the box. They didn't have the sauces, so the gave us ketchup to go with over cooked shrimp/bacon and extremely greasy fries."
"Terrible slow service.Waited one hour for oil change Won't come again to this place...."
"We were in Pittsburgh for one night and Olive or Twist was near our hotel.  There were many other restaurants, but this place looked nice.  The atmosphere was nice, and if I was rating only for atmosphere I'd give it 4 stars.  However, I'm mainly rating their food and service.  We were greeted promptly, but after that the service was spotty and it took awhile to receive our drinks/food even though there weren't many people in the dining room.  I ordered the Traditional French Dip Sandwich and Fries.  I enjoy a good French Dip and have tried many of them at all types of restaurants and this one was the worst I've ever eaten. In fact, I couldn't finish it.  The meat tasted like old lunch meat and the bread was nothing more than a cheap, glorified hot dog roll that was soggy.  It wasn't soggy from the Au Jus, but it tasted like they steamed the roll for some reason.  Overall, if I was going back to Pittsburgh in this area, I would stay far away from Olive or Twist."
"I've actually had OK experiences at this place in the past but this trip was especially bad. I tried to stop here with my husband for an appetizer and a drink before heading into the theater district - bad move.  Upon being seated the server explained that they were no longer serving food because of a water leak or something unsanitary-sounding. Klassy. For reasons I truly can't explain, we decided to stay for a beer before heading to our destination. We both threw down a brew nasty, paid and left. Unfortunately for Olive or Twist, the visit would probably be our last.On a positive note, there was an interesting man setting up for what looked like a live acoustic set. His warm-up sounded good but we left before he really got started. When it's all said and done, we should have just went to the Sharp Edge down the street. Probably a much safer bet for future endeavors."
Owner or manager was very rude when we presented our yelp deal.
"This bar is cramped, overpriced, and the service is unbelievably slow. Happy Hour runs 4-6, so you'll show up at 5, have no place to sit or stand, and will only be able to get *maybe* 2 drinks during happy hours You'll then be told that the upstairs (which is actually not bad) will be opening at 5, even though you're asking at 5:20 (this has seriously happened all three times I've been there).Seriously, avoid this place. When one of your co-workers suggests a work happy hour, direct them anywhere else."
"Very disappointed.  I had been to Olive or Twist for drinks and really enjoyed it but had never been there for a meal.  I was going to a show at the Benedum with a friend and made reservations about a week and a half before the show.  We arrived about 15 minutes early for our 6:00 reservation expecting we may not be able to be seated yet.  The problem is that even though I called and made a reservation (including the person answering the phone taking my name and phone number and repeating the date and time) we were told there was no reservation for our name.  The hostess said something along the lines of ""are you sure you called here to make a reservation and not somewhere else""  Yes, I'm pretty sure I called the right restaurant...  She kept looking at the room of empty tables, looking at the book and then looking at us.  After a few minutes of back and forth, she told us the lounge upstairs was open and we were welcome to grab a table up there.  So we trudged upstairs.  All that was available were small high top tables.  Being a Friday night, it was packed with the happy hour crowd and was pretty noisy.  Not really the environment we were looking for but we decided to make the most of it.We started with the Buffalo Chicken Dip appetizer.  It is served in a martini glass with toasted/fried pita chips.  It was tasty and we were surprised at how much dip there actually was.  The problems with food began with the pacing of the meal.  We had our appetizer for under five minutes when our entrees came out.  It may not have been a big deal if we were at a real table in the restaurant downstairs, but being at the high top bar tables, we had no room for our drinks, appetizer and meal.  We found ourselves stacking stuff and pulling things off the table in order to fit everything.  It was frustrating.  Not to mention that we would either have to let our entrees get cold as we finished the appetizer or let the appetizer get cold as we ate our entrees.  With as much as we enjoyed the appetizer, we were looking forward to our meals. Unfortunately, they were very disappointing.  My friend ordered the french dip sandwich with a side of mashed potatoes.  Her potatoes were ice cold and sandwich luke warm.  When she mentioned it to the server, the server said ""so would you like me to take them back or are they ok""  When would cold mashed potatoes ever be OK?  When her potatoes were brought back warmed, she was disappointed because they were called ""garlic mashed"" but she said they were pretty bland with not much garlic at all.I ordered the Caribbean Jerk Chicken.  It was described as ""grilled chicken seasoned with jerk spices, pepper jack cheese, garlic mayo and pineapple chutney on a Kaiser roll""  No mention of a tomato.  When I got the sandwich, there were three tomatoes on it.   Thankfully I just dislike tomatoes and it wasn't an allergy issue.  There was also no pineapple chutney.  When I asked about it, the server told me they use a sauce and it must have been soaked into the roll.Overall, very disappointed.  I wanted to love Olive or Twist because I really enjoyed the time I had visited for a drink, but the dining experience was sorely lacking, especially for a dinner that was supposed to be a nice laid back start to our girl's night out."
"At the request of a friend, we had a brief girls night out at Olive or Twist. My first impression was the outdated decor. The restaurant has carpet which I find off putting. The drink menu is extensive; but, with the exception of one person in my party, we each found our drinks far too sweet. I ordered the cucumber basil martini, which was so sweet I had to send it back. The food was mediocre. I ordered the burger medium and it was over cooked to nearly well done. And then there was the cheesy lounge singer who sang a mishmosh of singer songwriter tunes from the 80s. The music was so loud and so bad that my friends I left and headed down the street to Butcher and the Rye."
"I stopped in last night for a drink with a group of friends... we were in town visiting and I had been wanting to try this place out since we walked past it on the last trip... what a disappointment.  The server was prompt to greet us and drop off drink menus, but then she failed to return to take our order for at least 20 minutes.  It would've been different if she had been slammed, but the entire time she was standing by the bar, just talking to her coworkers.  By the time she came to take our order we were ready to leave... and we should have... the martinis were not good and the server's disposition left much to be desired.  When we were ready to leave she made us feel like it was a bother to split our tabs between the five of us.  The one positive of the place was that I liked the ambiance, but it wasn't enough to make up for everything else being lackluster.  What I was hoping to be a great ending to the night turned into a dismal experience that put everyone in a bad mood."
Not a fan of the service. Or I should say lack of. It literally killed me to leave a tip. No one deserves it. And I once tipped a server that never even waited on me before she left for the day. I overtip EVERYBODY and today it was all I could do to leave 20%.
"If you want a SNOTTY attitude this is the place for you, with sub-par food with high prices, you have found the perfect place for a bad combination. Upon entering the door at 3:40 pm the hostess said to us (my daughter and I)"" We can seat you if you promise to leave by 6pm"", now take it there is 16-18 tables with one table occupied. I guess we promised, so she seat us at the worse table in the House, near the bathroom/kitchen and next to the fire extinguisher. When we told the waitress this table was not working, she threw our menus on the table next to us. The food was minimal in size and minimal care of preparation, my daughter order a salad with chicken, the salad came out first, then a plate of chicken came out later for the customer to put on top of salad. My salmon was bland, and asked for lemon to help the dish out, and never received the lemon.. left half the salmon uneaten.  DO NOT PATRONIZE THIS ESTABLISHMENT"
If you are a female group be prepared to be ignored by the male bartenders.  Stood patiently to get waited at the bar upstairs a male customer came up and he quickly served he pointed out to the bartender we had been standing there and he just looked at him like so what.  Guess the men at olive or Twist only like men.
"I had mixed feelings coming here on a Monday night for dinner after hearing about a really bad experience a friend of mine had not too long ago. We had a groupon that my girlfriend had purchased and we had to use it because it was expiring that week. The place was a bit crowded nothing outrageous that would make us want to go somewhere else, we were actually seated within five minutes with no reservation so far so good right? Well that's where it ended. Our waitress was the textbook version of horrible service. Drinks took forever to be delivered to our table, my girlfriends food was cold, and she forgot the soup that we had ordered. The food itself was decent ( I had the pepper crusted salmon) and the drink was just ""meh"". I really don't feel sorry at all for our waitress all, her attitude was horrible, and she wasn't really busting her butt waiting on multiple tables. Let it be known, if you plan on taking orders without writing them down, you better be able to deliver. The ""acting manager"" sat down at our table and apologized and took an extra 15% off our bill. I couldn't wait to get out of there and don't have any plans on returning anytime soon."
My husband and I waited until after 10pm to come here because it was busy for a private event! I had my eyes set on the short ribs which is basically roast!!!!!! Yes roast! Enough said not impressed not happy and being we came up from Syracuse we obviously will never return! $70 bill and it wasn't good at all!!!!!
"Completely agree with Deborah: decent sandwich on absolutely horrible bread - mealy tomato and brown lettuce, too.  I know it was only $4/$7 for a 6""/12"" sub, but it was pretty bad.  (I bought a 12"", intending to take half home for later, but I wound up throwing the second half away, and I NEVER throw away food.)  As a Italian grocery, it seems okay, but the attitudes are a little snippy, and it's a pretty grungy-looking place."
"Maybe it's nostalgia for the cigar but I thought he looked ridiculous. He bragged about a $4 pepperoni roll. There's a reason it cost that, because it wasn't very good. The sauce was disappointing. I wouldn't come here for anything."
"The italian coldcut sub was a travesty! Lots of STALE bread with skimpy meat portions, and no hots or flavor. Bread better suited for pigeons than people. I can find better Italian sandwiches back home in Baltimore. We'll feed these to our dogs when we get home.  You get what you pay for. Avoid this tourist trap!"
"First time in Pittsburgh, from Chicago. 1. NO ONE SEEMS TO KNOW HOW THE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM WORKS.2. What is with the silly system of paying on your way out sometimes? It seems like the dumbest idea ever.3. Where are the reloadable transit cards?4. Why are the conductors so incredibly angry?5. Why do I need to request a stop on the ""T""?Of the public transportation systems I've used, this is definitely the most confusing so far. Even if the website had an easier to understand fare explanation.Learn from the CTA. I have a new appreciation for Chicago Transit Authority."
"Last night marked the second time in a week that I waited 30 minutes or more for a 71B in the freezing cold rain.   I was 5 minutes early for the bus I was trying to catch.  I can understand a delay during rush hour, but this was not.  The bus was running every 20 minutes both times, according to the PAT schedule. When I gave up last night and went into my apartment, it was an additional 10 minutes before the bus went by...So let's review: I waited a total of 45 minutes for a bus that was supposed to be coming past every 20 minutes.  For shame!From now on, I'll be hoofing it across the East End instead of buying a bus pass.  It will be cold, but at least I'll be moving."
"Don't ever get too comfortable with PAT--- they end up swiping everything out from under your feet, and then charging you a crapload for it.  I can't believe they're slashing more routes, and charging more!  Why would I pay you for continual service downgrades?!!?  You're not even offering a bus to the airport anymore here soon--- Do you know how many people ride that bus to WORK at/around the airport.  I tell you what.... Whoever runs your company is A DUMBASS to the 10th degree.Get your shit together.  Seriously.  Id rather walk from my work downtown, to my home in Oakland (thats an hour walk, and MORE than a mile) while Im 8 months pregnant,  than pay you assholes to take me home. P.S. I didnt even want to give it ONE star."
I bought a home over 3 and half years ago because it was on a bus line. One  year after they cut that  route after being there over 50 years. I think the way they operate is beyond poor and every year there is a far increase now i have to drive to a park in ride. You never know what you going to intale every day on teh bus. Ive been taking for about 10 years now and i think ive seen everything to the pee smell to no air to no heat to arguements between drivers and riders. If they continue on this path there will be no service to downtown just people who live in the city. They crossed out the suburbs. It should be the port authority of pittsburgh not allegheny county. The only thing is can say is the port authority drivers do a great job putting up with what they got. Oh and did i mention i cant tell you how many times they have broken down. Now they have a federal grant for the connectcard about time. Its only been in new york and dc for years!!! I am sure there will be lots of bugs in this system to
"The only pro about Port Authority is it gets you from point a to point b. I've had buses that smell like pee. I've had buses where the bus drivers are yelling at drivers or people downtown. Screaming insults out the window.  Had a bus driver doing like 70mph down McKnight road. At least twice a week I get a bus that's farebox is broke.  Yeah a free ride is nice but port authority is always crying wanting to increase their already ridiculous fare prices. Routes are always getting cut which leaves buses jam packed. They introduce the connect card (an alternative to cash and passes. If I load $20.00 onto the card I should be able to get a transfer without entering cash the drivers don't know that and argue about it.  Feel free to train your employees. On an 80 degree day one buses heat was on full blast. Not the drivers fault. He finally pulled over restarted the bus and it read 98 degrees before the air worked.Buses are late all the time.  When going to work I need to leave at least an hour before I should have to, to ensure I get to work on time. I can go on forever..."
"Officials estimated about 400,000 people would be in downtown for the 4th of July.  I wish someone had informed the Port Authority of this.  Maybe then they would have had more than one bus running every 20 minutes after the fireworks.  Every single bus stop in downtown had about 300 people waiting for the already overcrowded buses.  If a bus actually did stop (some were so full, they just drove by), fights would break out over who of the 300 people would get one of four standing room only spots on the bus."
"How is it port authority has the money to build a pointless over pass on the east liberty busway, but can't update their online system for smart phones to be able to determine where a bus is located at? I waited two hours today in the freeZing cold to get to work. Had to call off it was just to cold out!"
"Terrible customer experience. Sunday May 24th at 8:30 pm route 64 outbound, Centre and Graham stop. 2 people (including a senior woman) and me were standing at the stop, the bus came around 6 minutes late and didn't stop. I chase it and caught it at the next stop on a red light and when I asked the driver why he hadn't stopped he said it was probably us who didnt stand next to the stop. He kept on arguing loudly and even yelled and cursed. This driver should be taught customer service essential requirements."
"The Port Authority runs a convoluted and inconsistent transit network - I hate Uber's business model, but there's a good reason services like it have found such a hold on Pittsburgh. The buses stop running regularly between 10:30-11:30 on weeknights and around midnight on the weekends, some buses require you to pay on exiting, which is bizarre; the timetables on the weekends sometimes feature forty-five-minute gaps between buses and the T only serves the South Hills. In general, I'm disappointed as a new resident without a car to have discovered Pittsburgh to be such a car-centric city when there are so many ways the Port Authority could be improved and expanded. As I write this I'm half an hour late to work due to a late 28x - if you need to be somewhere, leave 90min in advance or risk being as unpunctual as the buses."
"First off:  I'm a picky eater, so take this with a grain of salt.Okay, I'm not from pittsburgh.  I am not overweight, not a hipster, not on any of the plethora of drugs, I own my own home,  Probably most of all, I've never heard anything about this place before walking in, so I had no idea what to expect besides ""Lets get breakfast.""If you are the opposite of any of these points, this place is probably worth a try for you.We had a horrendous wait, but I think that was a complete fluke:  we had a huge group and there was an event that weekend...I don't think anyone with less than 3-4 had that long of a wait at all.The waitresses are ornery, but not rude...just clear.  They aren't going to make nice or kiss your rear, they're not there for that.  I found this respectable, and liked it.But the food?  Oh God.Pros:  Portions are massive, all the other reviews will tell you that.            1) Prices are reasonable, cheap even, but I suppose that has something to do with the fact that the first pound or two of your meal is pure potato.  Seriously...I think I had at *least* three idaho russets in chipped form on my plate alone.            2) ....uhm.  ....  Nothing was dry?Cons:  There was no color anywhere.  Absolutely everything on every plate I saw in the place was some blend of beige.  Potatoes, egg white, pancake, sausage...after you tilted the whatever-grease-that-was out of your dish, everything was the same color.               Half my dish was potato.               The egg was not over-medium, it was still-runny, even the whites.  I presume this was because they were slammed, and didn't have time to cook what were almost certainly factory-chicken eggs.             The sausage was not identifiably sausage.             I had my entire day's required calories in butter alone on the toast.             There was seriously nothing remotely healthy on this menu.  Nothing raw, nothing green, nothing fresh, not even as an ingredient. Even McDonalds has a fruit cup, ffs!  TACO BELL has better quality food!             Take one look at the clientele when you walk in.  It attracts exactly the kind of people you would picture in a dingy greasy-spoon truck-stop.  If you are not one of those people, Do Not Bother, this place makes Denny's look classy."
"Clearly based on other reviews, I should try this during daylight hours. We went after a long night out, landing there around 2:30. I've been to plenty of late night places, after-hour bars, etc, but I've never been as scared as I was at Jo-jo's. 2 fights broke out while we were there. First a group of guys, then their girlfriends. Then a guy at the next table threw up on the ground -some splashing on my leg. Then we heard police sirens and the fights were escalating - so we bolted. Maybe this is a rare experience? Anyway - I won't be heading back anytime soon!"
"I rented a car with this location as the drop off point. I returned the car to the parking garage as instructed and then went to the front desk. I signed all paper work and returned the keys. About 4 days later I received an awful phone call where I was being accused of causeing damage to this vehicle. I became very angry. I called the location back and was again accused of causing ""concrete"" damage to the vehicle. I asked the lady if they had viewed the cameras in the parking garage to which she replied, ""We don't own the cameras."" The lady wanted me to write a report stateing I hadn't run into anything. When I asked her what would happen if I didn't waste my time as a customer writing a report she replied, we'll do what we have to do. I will never ever use this company again nor recomend them to anyone else, worst experience and customer service ever!"
"The food was just OK. Soggy french fries on a greasy cheese steak pattie.  The service was awful, noise, and not helpful for a newcomer to Primantis and Pittsburgh."
"We ate at Primanti Bros based on the reviews on Yelp, hoping to get a real taste of Pittsburgh. What I ordered was a sandwich labeled Pittsburgher Cheese Steak. What I got was an inedible slab of overcooked mystery meat, cole slaw, and mediocre fries, on white bread. The sandwich was very small, but I only ate 1/2 of it anyway, and I have a pretty big appetite. I recently ate a 20 oz cheeseburger at a local burger joint.I was truly shocked. That was the worst meat that I have seen since Junior High School. We would have been much better off at Burger King. Luckily we had a nice lunch at Salim's to wash the taste of this junk of our mouths."
"Worst sandwich on Earth.I'd rather eat a dead whore.Please...never come here."
"oh primanti's, you always disappoint! how can so much food bear so little taste? despite a brilliant premise (put all your edibles in the sandwich, leave your other hand free for the potables) the execution leaves much to be desired.1. these guys can never seem to cook their fries properly. they are always greasy on the outside, raw and mealy on the inside. don't think that just because they're INSIDE the sandwich doesn't mean you can get away with crappy fries.2. the bread. what the heck dudes? if you're going to put 3 lbs of ingredients in the sandwich, try to use a bread that doesn't immediately turn into insipid play-doh in your hands.I like disgusting junk food as much as anyone (see my rave review of the O), but I wish the primanti's goons would put a little bit more effort into their sandwiches. seriously guys -- take some pride in your work and make something good for once. and check the thermostat on your fryolator already!"
"GROSS!!! Many people told me to go here and I was totally disappointed! It was bland, the coleslaw was too tangy (and only contained cabbage) and the meat was scary! Good thing it's super cheap. Do NOT get the cheese-steak sandwich if you go even though it says #2 best seller, it's awful! Okay on to service... Everyone seemed like they hated their job. Someone at my table asked for no tomatoes and add onions and of course she got tomatoes and no onions.Maybe I ordered the wrong thing and maybe they were all just having a bad day... Who knows."
"Everyone knows that that if you go to Pittsburgh, you go to Primanti Bros. (My friends and I were in town for a Pirates/Phillies game, and the PNC Park Primanti Bros was packed the entire game.) We visited the Market Square location, and if you eat on the patio, it's a fun place to hang out and drink some Iron City beers.  I got the Black Angus Sandwich. It was quite large, cut in half, and brought on a piece of wax paper. As it turned out, I'm pretty sure the wax paper would have tasted better. It was really, really, not good. I did eat the first half, but the bread was so tasteless, I thought maybe it would be better if I ate the other half piece by piece. The coleslaw was OK, but the french fries were awful, and the little bit of actual meat had little taste. We had little to no contact with employees, but a cab driver told us about a young couple who dared to ask for a sandwich at another Primanti Bros without coleslaw, and were treated really rudely. Because you know, people being rude is hilarious. So I guess if you want an authentic Pittsburgh experience then go here. But if you want actual decent food, avoid at all costs"
"My family always wanted to try Primanti. What a huge disappointment at the Anchor drive one. The pizza was served with a mound of burnt ashes on the bottom. Not a little, but teaspoons of it, all over. The ovens are not cleaned. I ordered the fish sandwich which came out cold, a soppy mess from the oil on the bread and a chunk of coleslaw core inedible. My sons was no better. The waitress saw we had taken only one bite and asked if we wanted to take home. We both said 'no way.' She didn't flinch and didn't care. I don't care to ever go back and will tell friends to avoid. In Philly, they'd be out of business in a heartbeat. It is also a dirty, noisy unkempt premises."
After sitting there and being ignored for 25 minutes we just left!
"Clearly should have read a few reviews before going here. Whenever I go to these types of iconic regional dining establishments, I order the house specialty to best judge the place on its supposed merits. Since it was 11 in the morning, I chose not to order Primanti's #1 best seller, which the waitress told me was beer, but perhaps that would have made my experience better. As it was, I ordered the #2 best seller, the cheese steak. It was heinous. Think a grimy, mechanically separated Salisbury-style steak with a meager slice of provolone on sliced Italian bread served signature Primanti-style: with coleslaw, tomatoes, and fries.First, the steak was disgusting: terrible flavor (smelled and tasted like hippie armpit, which I'm not necessarily opposed to as long as it's not involved in something I'm trying to eat) with a gross, processed meat texture. Secondly, the fries easily overwhelmed the sandwich, with their old fryer grease taste. Additionally, the sandwich was unwieldy and threatening to fall apart at every turn--a trait I don't hold against decent-tasting sandwiches, but this lack of structural integrity just added insult to injury. My dining partners were equally disgusted by their choices: corned beef and ham & cheese sandwiches, respectively. Easily the best part of the meal was the Smallman Street Fries, and those were equally lack-luster. The ""bacon"" was simply bacon bits (oh, the humanity!), the chili was uninspired, and the cheese sauce and sour cream did little but soggy the fries. (Did I mention they tasted like old fryer grease?)  I will never go back and I will immediately disregard the culinary opinions of anyone who thinks Primanti Bros. produces decent food."
"Wildly overrated.  I compare it to Pat's and Geno's in Philly, good when your drunk, but only when your drunk.I went to Pitt for 4 years and I have to say I never understood the Primantis hype.  I dont know how you get famous for putting fries on a sandwich when the fries suck.  They are soggy and tasteless, maybe the worst I've ever had.  I will say the coleslaw is pretty good, and I'm not usually a coleslaw guy, but it doesnt make up for all the other shortcomings.  Half the sandwich falls out while your eating.  The ""cheesesteak"" might be the most tasteless sandwich ever.  You have to use a whole bottle of hot sauce just to get a little flavor.  Primantis sucks...go to Fatheads on the Southside or Uncle Sam's in Oakland."
Really bad service. Make sure to get in the face of the wait staff or count on being ignored
"ate at the one in North Versailles. floor filty, all young kids running the place, poor service, poorly made sandwich, very bad overall. The should have a manager on duty. I wont be back. thanks"
"So this is a Pittsburgh instiitution??  Am so underwhelmed.  After waiting more than 20 minutes for our sandwiches (in the end these are still just sandwiches), they came out cold - and I'm not just talking about the meat, lettuce, tomatoes - everything was cold including the fries.  What a disappointment.  Head to DiBellas - much better service, subs and sandwiches."
"Previous reviews have said it well: Lackluster, tasteless food.Ate at Primanti Bros with a group of friends while in Pittsburgh; we heard about it from 'Man vs. Food' and were assured that it is a Pittsburgh institution. The sandwiches are large and the pricing is fine ($6-$9), but what you get is a sloppy sandwich with food service-grade meat topped with lukewarm fries. Good in theory, bland in execution; it's a lot of calories without the accompanying flavor.We also had terrible service at the Market Square location; I'll chalk this up to a fluke. The patio seating at the Market Square location is wonderful on a sunny day, but it started to rain and they actually retracted the awning, explaining that it wasn't designed to get wet --but apparently their customers are.The legacy and infamy might tempt you to eat here, but take your money elsewhere and buy good-tasting food instead of kitsch."
"There was basically no cheese on my ""cheese combo sandwich"", the fries were gross, and the waitress was nasty to us."
"Well, it finally happened: I had to give a place a single star. And it kills me that the place I gave it to had to be Primanti's. I'm an awful Pittsburgher.I don't give low ratings easily or often, so believe me: this place pushed all of my buttons to earn this awful review. In fact, the single star was only earned because the place is cleaner and more comfy than some of the other Primanti places I've been too. It kind of has an old diner feeling to it and I liked that. Alas, that's all I liked.So, why such a low score? Well:The service was terrible. After spending twenty minutes sitting without anyone coming to refill my water or ask for my actual order - note, the place was almost completely empty - I went to the register to ask for something to eat, which I'd started to think I had to do after watching a couple people do the same (in hindsight, I probably misinterpreted their actions, but my mistake does not excuse what happened next). My waiter looked at me and went, ""Don't you get the concept of a restaurant? Haven't you been to any restaurants, like, ever? Sit back down and I'll take your order."" And not even in a joking manner that made me feel like I could smile about my mistake - this guy was being a condescending, rude, arrogant person. It was unbelievable. Utterly, totally unbelievable. If I hadn't met company there that night, I would have walked out right then.To make matters worse, this was not a good night to order anything at Primanti's. The coleslaw was way too sweet and there was far too much of it, the fries were bland and had no texture at all, and there was barely any meat on my sandwich at all. The result? A big pile of carbs that really didn't taste great after the first few bites, rather than a delicious sandwich.Before you all kill me, please note: I LIKED my meal at Mt. Lebanon's Primanti location. They also have a more diverse menu, which is always a bonus for me - I like having more options. I think in the future, I will stick to that location in this local chain, where even on a busy night I managed to get food in a decent amount of time. I certainly will not be coming to the downtown location if I spot my previous, downright awful waiter working there again."
"I can't for the life of me figure out why all the hype. I was warned by others that this is mainly where tourists eat. But I'm a tourist here, and wanted to try it.It was a sandwich mostly of slaw and fries.  The thick white bread was dry and boring; too crusty. The fries on the sandwich overpowered the taste! So I dismantled it. When the rude server asked how I liked it, I was honest. He gave me big time attitude and commented that I took it apart. I told him, I took it apart because it was a horrible sandwich (the pastrami, by the way). And that, sir, is why you got a $0.35 tip! (never give a zero tip, they'll think you forgot, always leave just a small amount of change)If you have to put all that hot sauce on the sandwich to make it palatable, why bother?  (The server, as he walked away, told me it's really good with hot sauce, which was just Tabasco, which I don't like, any way!)They left off the tomato that supposedly comes with each sandwich!Of the 4 staff members I came in contact with, all but 1 were rude, unfriendly and uncaring. One constantly walked by trash that had blown off outdoor tables without picking it up.The fries were good. Nope, won't be back."
"I've heard all the hype and wanted to try it.  Tonight was my second attempt here.   First time, new girl on the grill apologized to me at 10 minutes, at 15 I walked.  Not even an acknowledgement from the wait staff.   Tonight, the waiter seemed mad that I didn't know what I wanted to order.  After I explained that I'd never been there, he brought me a menu and then proceeded to ignore me for 10 minutes.  I walked again.  No more tries here.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong?  Haha."
"Had lunch here while visiting friends in the area .... After seeing all the hype about this place on various tv food shows I was very excited to eat hear . WOW ,,, what a dissapointment , This place is so over hyped it isnt funny . To compare this place to the famous sandwich places is NYC is a joke . The sandwiches may be big , but only because they are over stuffed with fries and cole slaw . To steal a line from a old TV commercial .... WERE'S THE BEEF .....  A major major dissapointment ."
"I was really looking forward to a huge tasty sandwich but was greatly disappointed! Everything was bland, nothing had seasoning, not even basic salt. Soggy fries, tasteless meat, average coleslaw on white bread trying to double for Italian bread. Save your time, money and calories and go to Wendy's instead."
"Super slow service. They have inside and outside seating which is nice. However, they only have two waitresses outside for about 20 tables. They don't take your entire order they only take your drink order and then your good order. It took 10 minutes to get our drink order. After finally getting our drinks she waited another ten minutes to come get our food. When we ordered our food when I asked for light coleslaw she said they can't do that and for me to just take it off. She explained that they just put fistfuls on it. So why can't they just put less fistfuls on it? Our waitress was very rude and didn't make me feel welcomed at all. She never introduced herself and just treated us like animals. I would never tell anybody to go to the Primanti Brothers again downtown. The one in Oakland is so much nicer and better quality. It's really bad management to have only two people serving outside when there are over 20 tables. It's not fair for the customers or for the servers. While the food was good as always it wasn't worth the wait because it just took to long. The service wasn't nice at all and I wouldn't tell anybody to come here when it's crowded."
"I had lived outside of Pittsburgh for a couple of years and have eaten at this Primanti Brothers location four or five times. Their sandwiches were always tasty, worth the wait and the trouble of finding parking etc. So, when my parents came to visit, and we made a trip out that-a-way, I knew that would be a lunch stop. We ended up coming into Pittsburgh on Sunday around 1pm. I knew it would be crowded and anticipated having a wait. We got a table after 15 to 20 minutes and quickly sat down before someone else did. It took the waitress about 10 minutes to come and clear the previous customers remnants, which was ok. We ordered our beers and were told that she'd come back and take our order. She came back 20 minutes later, with the beers and took our order. After that, we sat around and waited for our sandwiches for 35 minutes. When we did finally get our food, it was ice cold. The fries in the sandwich were completely soggy and cold, and the meat was barely warm. Our table ran out of napkins, and we asked for some, but they never came, finally, the table next to ours handed us a few. Maybe it was because it was cold, but the sandwiches weren't that great. I had very little meat in mine, and more coleslaw that anything else. Also, the thickness of the bread seems to have increased since I last ate here because about 60% of my sandwich was bread. We were fairly disgruntled about the whole thing, but were still going to leave a tip for the waitress. Then, my dad went to the bar to pay. He stood there for 10 minutes, behind another customer. The server came up to them and said 'what the hell are you doing up here?', in those words!! My dad was so stunned be just stood there, the guy in line ahead of him told her that he was waiting to pay his bill, so she cashed him out and then turned around to do something else, when my dad said 'excuse me, i need to pay too', she replied to him ' Jeez, you guys are so demanding! Why the hell are you in such a hurry"". That is when their tip went straight out the door with us. We were ok waiting for a table, we were even ok waiting for our food; it took them one hour from the time we sat down, to the time we got our food, and then the server had the audacity to behave in that manner. Either Primanti Brothers has become too big for their boots and let things slide, or they need to train their staff to be more polite and efficient. We will definitely not be coming back the next time we are in town. Our money is better spent else where."
Worst service ever.  The waitress and I use that term loosely rolled her eyes at any question when ordering and yelled at someone at the table for asking for coleslaw on the side.  Then she had to come back and re ask the orders again and got mad when we repeated about the coleslaw since she didn't repeat it back.  When she brought out the food she just slammed the food down and just shouted out the name of one of the sandwiches um are you asking who had which sandwich which is your job to remember anyways.  I'm glad I don't live in Pittsburgh to have to worry about avoiding this place.
"Can I give this place ZERO stars? They're supposively ""famous"" for their sandwiches so some friends and I go when we are in town. The waitresses all rolled their eyes and glared at me for not wanting my fries on top of my sandwich. (Not to mention the waitress was in the skimpiest tank top with her bra hanging out while waiting on us and grilling food. Gross.) I get that your famous for having fries on the sandwich but regardless, a customer should be able to get what they want. This place was trashy, dirty and probably not even up to code."
"This is the most overrated place bragged about in Pittsburgh. My first visit was to the one in South Hills. Waited 90 mins for 4 sandwiches. The coleslaw is gross and I'm a fan of coleslaw. Due to the 90 min wait I was given a gift card which I used at the one in Market Square. This time I got the grilled chicken salad. If you like chewing on rubber bands, I recommend it. It was the absolute worst salad I've ever had, how can you screw up a salad? The chicken was tasteless and rubbery. Got it to go and the girl who took the order over the phone was rude and rushed and was equally rude when I picked it up. She assumed she knew my name and my order and handed me a random bag of food. I told her I was missing a sandwich and she tossed another bag at me without saying a word. I will NEVER go back to any of these locations. I'd rather eat a ham sandwich from Sheetz. At least I can get that without an attitude. If you have friends coming to visit from out of town, take them anywhere but here. And for those who say you have to go to the original one in the Strip, no thanks, it's the same food. If you are looking for an awesome sandwich go to Schmitz Old World Deli in Greenfield."
"Service sucked big time on Monday, June 9, at the Primanti's in Market Square. It took more than a half hour for my wife to get a cheese steak and the place wasn't even crowded. Missed the first inning of the Pirates game as a result. Boo!"
Great food overall at all locations! Go to another location to eat though. The Market Square location has the most horrible service I've ever experienced. Horrible!
Absolutely horrible! Frozen meat patty with a dog food like taste and texture on the P'burgher. Seriously how does this place survive? Read Sarah F. review as it mirrored or experience at the strip district location. Will never return to any location!
"Service was bad. Server walked away before we were done ordering and then when someone got her attention she had to return 5 minutes later to re clarify which it was wrong. We didn't see her for a good 20 minutes and had to go up to the bar for refills. She did take one of our cups to refill it, sat it on the bar and left it there for 10 minutes, when we finally saw her again had to ask her to grab it off the bar. Highly disappointing Philly cheesesteak!! The meat in it is that of a frozen Salisbury steak TV dinner!! French fries were good."
"First Yelp review ever. Not impressed at all! 45% bread, 25% cole slaw, 25% fries, and 5% meat. The bread is cold and not grilled or warmed on the grill. Avoid and eat else where. Don't even think about the wings (dry and no flavor)."
"Place sucks. Loser rude servers ignore you even if you stand at a register and wait- you will get ignored. This place is going down. Server said""you don't matter - I have a million people to take care of""  This was after waiting 20+ minutes at the register with cash in hand. I understand it's busy- but acknowledge people - appreciate customers! When you tell us to F off- you ar going DOWN! Rude! Not worth it."
"Very bad foods. No flavor, very dried and under-seasoned. Very bad service. They were rude. They had open each sandwich, break them into half, look into it to know what it is and start calling the name of the sandwich out at the table.  I do not recommend this place. I should have gone to subway."
"The only thing this place has going for it is the local hype. The sandwiches lack flavor, it's just another one of those places you have to try once to say you did."
"Many Pittsburgh locals suggested I give this place a shot when I took a business trip here. If this place is considered good to the locals, then I feel sorry for the people of Pittsburgh.I ordered the Pittsburgher cheese steak and the Kolbassi & cheese. For both sandwiches, the bread used was extremely bland and borderline stale.  The bread would crumble with each attempted bite, eventually leading to me abandoning them.  The fries were so dry and stale tasting as well that I thought it better to just throw them out. The veggies were about average, not fresh, but didn't taste gross.  All that was left were the cheese and the meats. They may have been the most disappointing because I thought that I could maybe at least enjoy that. Essentially, the entire sandwich was inedible and I settled for Five Guys instead."
"The sandwiches seem like a neat idea because they're stuffed with Fries and coleslaw.  But that's about all you taste when you eat their sandwiches.  In reality there's very little meat, lots of bread, lots of fries, and as a result their sandwiches are very dry and flavorless. Add lots of ketchup to help the chewing process."
"Saw this place featured on the travel channel and was looking forwarded to trying it.  Got here and the place had limited customers and were not busy, service was poor and they were out of a variety of items.  I had the pastrami &cheese sandwich and it was good, but overall this place is overrated, very disappointed, considering the reviews from the travel channel.....Never coming back"
"Being from LA, I was disappointed with the tacos. The Carne Asada was bland and didn't think this is authentic Mexican food but another street faire."
"This review is for the taco stand in front of Reyna's, which is run by the same owner as Reyna's and Casa Reyna. Note that this is *not* the same stand as the one around the corner on 21st Street, across the alley from Pamela's.I got an order of three tacos from them on a cold day a couple weekends ago. The meat was cold before I could start eating it, and I assumed it had just cooled off quickly. Within a few hours everything I had eaten was leaving me in a hurry. I felt sick and weak for the rest of the day, and was better (and completely empty) the next morning.Never going back, of course. This doesn't directly reflect on Casa Reyna's inside restaurant, but since the same people run it, it makes me worry about their food handling standards.I'll probably keep getting Reyna's big bag of chips when I need them for a party, but I'm never eating any other prepared food from them again."
"I was so excited to make it to Reyna, their selection is great. However when I brought home and opened one of the spices it had flies in it, another jar of pepper paste was one year expired and a bag of chilli sauce was expired since 2013. Completely unacceptable and disgusting to sell such expired food to your customers. Check the expiration dates on all purchase from here!!!"
OMG what a nightmare. I was there last saturday at 9pm with a group of 10 people in the second floor bar area. The bartenders acted like it was a big inconvience that we were there. ordered drinks and didnt even get a thank you. the bar was dirty and littered with dirty glasses. The restrooms were filthy and didnt even have toliet paper . We left the bar and spent a HUGE anoun of money up the street.. I will never go back.
Another place that I visit once every few years thinking it couldn't be as bad as I remember it.  And the place NEVER lets me down; it's just as bad as I remember.  The seafood is breaded and fried to the point of inedible.  The staff is rude.  The prices are too high for the quality.  Just all around disappointing.
"I hesitate to even write this review because technically we didn't eat here.  But after reading the other reviews, I thought ""Eh, what the hell.""We came in and were seated at 5:45pm for desserts/drinks.   By 6:05, we still hadn't seen our waitress.  We decided it wasn't worth it and just left.I did eat here a month ago, and yes -- the fried fish was fried to the point where it was beyond greasy.  And then to pay around $20 for that?  LOL.  Right.I won't be back."
"Went to this place for lunch last Saturday, party of five. The service was extremely slow and every beer we tried to order, got the response ""We are out of that one"". Finally when we got our sandwiches (after a long wait) but no coleslaw and fries were soggy and stale. When asked the waitress for coleslaw (which is supposed to be the side with every sandwich), the response was ""I think we are out, but let me check"". And the waitress didn't return until after we were done eating. Forget about getting a refill for your drink or water.."
"NEVER AGAIN!!!! Horrible service and horrible food! It took 20 minutes for our waitress to even come to our table! Looking back on it, I don't know why we didn't leave... maybe because we had to wait 20 minutes to even get a table (this was during the summer). We ordered the muscles to start off which were okay but definitely not something I would recommend. My husband ordered the fish and chips and I ordered the crab cakes.... EPIC FAIL!!! The crab cakes were so disgusting my husband and I had to switch meals. The crab cakes taste like fried mayo... I couldn't even taste the crab! The fish and chips looked great but it didn't taste like anything! No seasoning at all! The waitress was so bad that when it came time to give us our check, she was no where to be found. It took 15 minutes to actually get the check (keep in mind we already finished eating)... thank God we had cash! A complete waste of $40. Yes, I remember exactly how much I spent even though it was months ago because I kept thinking how I could have spent that money in a better place! I could have got a mani & pedi... had some great sushi... the list goes on. lol"
"My husband and I went tonight for dinner.  Bad mistake.  Worst meal we've ever had.  The salad actually tasted like it had a moth ball in it.  The sword fish we ordered seemed more like a piece of fatty beef that could not be cut with a knife!  The fried calamary was absolutely terrible, it was as if someone took a handfull of dough and fried it in clumbs and hid some meat in it!  The best part of it was that I got a refund on a soup that I didn't even recieve!  I don't recommend unless your drinking and don't care how your food taste.  Busy, slow and awful."
"We had a frustrating and disappointing experience at Roland's, a dining out experience on a recent 4-day visit to Pittsburgh.First, all of the food was extremely overpriced. The quality was what you would find if you were ordering from a bar...but it was twice as expensive. The $16 I paid for fried cod got me two soggy cod filets, steamed bland vegetables and boring roasted potatoes. I couldn't have tried to make food this poor. It was a Sysco food operation gone wrong: runoff from Houlihan's mixed with Joe's Crab Shack. The service was so slow that we were cancelling orders due to the delay in bringing them to the table. My dish arrived without any sort of sauce, and we even had to get up and order beer from the bar because our waitress was so behind. It was her ""second day on the job,"" but this is unacceptable. They could have at least comp'd our beers, or offered some other way to make it up (besides coming over to informing us that they had charged the beers to our bill).Roland's had space available on a Monday night, unlike the other restaurants in the neighborhood. This was really convenient initially, but I now have an idea of why this was the case."
"I would give this restaurant 0 stars if I could.  The food was lousy, the drinks were expensive, and the service was awful.I complained to the manager about my experience and he told that if I didn't like it, there were plenty of other bars in The Strip District.Please, please, please go somewhere else."
"Yuck!It's almost embarrassing having this place exist in the Strip with so many tourists coming here.  That has to be how they're making their money because it's certainly not on their food or service.  Well, maybe it's the booze too...I don't even know where to begin.  Service was horrible.  The lunch took 2 hours.  On a leisurely Sunday that may be fine, but there was no leisure.  At least not with drinks not in hand until a 1/2 an hour after we sat down.  I'd say lunch was served another 1/2 to 45 minutes later.  It didn't matter though, I knew it wasn't going to be anything spectacular.  I'd heard rumors about the food.  I won't go into any details but I wouldn't trust some items on the menu.  I just played it safe and ordered a veggie salad.  The salad was in the entree section, so I assumed it would be a full size salad.  It was not.  It was a side salad with a handful of grilled veggies on top.  Nothing spectacular.  And a side salad at almost $11.  Not worth it.  If you are forced to stop in because you're dying of hunger, stick to a liquid diet:)"
"Just awful. My companions each ordered an Alfredo pasta and they both honestly thought (through the entire meal) that Roland's had served mashed potatoes on the pasta.We thought ""maybe it's a 'burgh thing.""Nope, we were informed at the end of the meal by the waiter that it was indeed Alfredo sauce and that the chef ""just liked to use a lot of parmesan cheese in his Alfredo."" This stuff was about the consistently of cold oatmeal with oil poured over it (no exaggeration) and there was a bucket full of it on each plate.Anybody who would serve what was on those plates has no business whatsoever in any kitchen. By the way, my lobster roll was a buttery, greasy fail as well.What a complete disaster."
"this place reeks of fish when you walk in and there are fruit flies everywhere.  Good place to dine if you're on a diet since you will surely lose your appetite.If you find yourself at Rolands, do yourself a favor and leave and dine anywhere else in the Strip District.  Seriously."
"If I had to chose between dining at Roland's again, or having to catch running chainsaws that were tossed at me I'd pick dining at Rolands but only by the slimmest of margins.Why on earth did I go back to this restaurant?  Clearly, I must not love myself or something.Want to pay too much money for fish that smells like a sewer?  Dine at Roland's.  The only reason to be at Rolands is to drink there.  they have a pretty decent beer selection."
"Roland's was recommended by hotel. Service was terrible. Food was cold. Brick oven pizza cold.... Asked to have it reheated , still came back cold. Steak was way over cooked. Never got appetizer we ordered, but was charged for it.  Was not busy but waitress was hard  to find. Would not go back and would not recommend this place to anyone."
"Friends warned me not to eat here. Turns out they were GOOD friends. This was just awful, start to finish. Slow (pitiful) service, nasty food ( and we each sprung for the lobster roll -- if you can call it that!) and a generally miserable experience. And this was an early lunch with very few customers around. The only thing remotely redeemable was that we sat on the balcony overlooking Penn avenue and were entertained by the people below. People watching can be a blast. I wanted a draft beer and was told that ""we don't serve draft beer upstairs"". What??? There's a bar there!! Are you kidding me?? So water it was and that took a long time to arrive. And without straws - another wait after I had the audacity to ask for them.  The ""lobster rolls"" arrived and looked mighty meager. That's not a lobster roll!! But I pressed on. As I got it closer to my mouth there was a slight aroma. But press on. The ""lobster"" was sparse, tough, and flavorless. How often could you say that about lobster??? Exactly!! It must have been harvested years ago and waited for me to show up so it could make its way out of the freezer. At $15 each this falls clearly into the ripoff category.  And trying to get our check? Ridiculous. I won't be back. Ever."
"So, four of us came in for the first time.Diner 1 - ordered the lobster roll sandwich.  Lobster on a roll, nothing more...that's it.  Nothing special - have no idea why people would rave about this.  A bland, poor excuse of a sandwich that does a disservice to all northeasterners who know what a lobster roll is, and this ain't it.  Is this lobster?  Read on.Diner 2 - ordered a large raw bar sampler, which was six Quahog clams, six oysters and six rubbery shrimp.  Who serves tough, chewy Quahogs on a raw bar?  This dive.  Also ordered the mussels, which were not seasoned and swimming in water.  No wine/garlic sauce as advertised on the menu - water.    Bland and awful.  Finished with the Mediterranean pizza which is spinach, feta and olives - the better part of the dinner.Diner 3 - steamed clams.  Again who serves Quahogs for steamed clams?  These amateurs.  Also had the clam chowder - which appropriately had minced Quahogs in it. Diner 4 - ordered the salad with the lobster roll, hold the bread.  Also asked for the lobster to be served chilled with it.  Lobster came hot and was dyed a deep red color.  Why the need to put lobster in a dye?   Because...it's not Maine lobster!  Imposter fish is dyed and artificially flavored, then frozen, then thawed, then microwaved at Roland's and called lobster.  That's my guess.Sent the mussels back.  No offer to reduce the check or offer a comped dessert.   Rest rooms are dirty, and smell of urine.  Men's was an awful smelling pit and I was told that the ladies had one toilet drenched with urine on the seat, another blocked up and overflowing and a third that could be used.This place is a smelly, dingy, dive bar with horrible food and poor service.  It is a trap for the unsuspecting tourist. You have been warned...STAY AWAY!"
"If 0 stars were possible I'd give em. Got back from here yesterday evening and I am physically ill. I didn't even touch the anemic, yellow and fishy smelling muscles - not that the waiter asked why we hadn't eaten them, more on this character in a moment. My ahi tuna steak was decent, but I think the scallops are what got me and my friend is sick as well. Just saying - check your food before the waiter walks off.Speaking of the waiter - one of the worst I've ever had the displeasure of umm being served by? That sounds awkward and vaguely jack-assy ... Hmm the mild poisoning I have is affecting my wit, but you follow me.This guy spilled half the water out of the oysters while trying to put a plate down, and didn't notice or say anything about it when he did; he asked me how I wanted my tuna steak prepared??! Worst of all he spoke in this low monotone while other customers and cars going by drown him out so all you can tell is he asked you something because he's standing there with this kind of 'come on!' look on his face - totally rude and completely inept. I was hard put to give 10% tip to be honest. I'd suggest the similar bar down the road for better quality food and service. Good luck out there!"
"I've tried and tried to give this place a chance.  It's upsets me that an establishment like this can exist among so many great places in the Strip.  I end up at Roland's because my boyfriend's co-workers always want to go there for happy hour.  They have a special on oysters and shrimp cocktail, so I ordered those.  The oysters were absolutely disgusting.  They were not fresh, or cleaned very well.  My fingers ended up getting all dirty and they had a gross, gritty taste to them.  They threw the POORLY deveined shrimp on ice, and it ended up soggy.  I had to pick the veins out myself, and after about two I lost my appetite.  As always, the service was terrible.  Next time I'm dragged to a happy hour there, I'll order water.  Never again will I spend money in this place.  YUCK!"
We wanted to eat there today. Waited for about 10 minutes at the entrance. No hostess coming up. Then she shows up saying that she will be back in another second. After additional 5 minutes we ask her what's going on. She did not apologize and says that it will take another 30 minutes. Really??!! Not the nice way to treat a party of 4 wanting to spend some money.
"Last weekend my mother and I headed down to the strip to get some weekly goods - lunch meat and cheese from Penn Mac - veggies at Stans - needed some new spices from Penzeys for a chili I was going to make that day....we were both a little hungry and knew we wanted to have a snack before shopping.We parked in front of Roland's and see the sign: Famous for Lobster Rolls and Bloody Mary's!Perfect. My mother got the Lobster Roll, which she said was 'good'. The bread, from Mancini's, was of course tasty - toasted and buttery - delicious mostly because it was Mancini's bread. I had the Lobster Roll minus the carbs on a salad - and the lobster was tasty, no doubt , I mean, lobster is just - good. For the price though, not sure that I got enough bang for my buck. The salad was something I could have picked up at Get-Go in the pre-made section. I just didn't feel satisfied at the end of my meal. I couldn't even drink my Bloody Mary (this is a rare affair), way too much horseradish, and I often like horseradish in my Bloodies!And it was cold - didn't even take my winter coat off. So, needless to say, not the best experience.Talk about false advertisement..."
"I really wanted to like this place. The beer choices and the casual menu was right up my alley. Unfortunately the food was not. The ""famous"" lobster roll had so much butter on it I think I am going to have a heart attack in my sleep tonight. Can't recommend the place."
Rough experience today - had one drink and left. Waited 15-20 minutes for service and it is not busy. When I said something - everyone wanted to blame someone else - waitress couldn't describe beer and didnt iffer to find out or sample it - brought 12 year old son a pop in a little kids cup. Waitress did apologize for cup but it was too late - chose to leave.
"WARNING ,,,,, this place is for SUCKERS ONLY ..... funky smelling ,worse tasting seafood ... overpriced ..... raunchy,un-clean restrooms .... only reason anyone goes here is because this is a ''tourist trap '' type neighborhood with some fun shopping spots nearby and this restaurant is positioned in the center of everything. As P.T. Barnum once said  '' There's a sucker born every minute '' ...... stay away ... any other restaurant will be better ."
"Stopped in on the Fourth of July for evening cocktail and small meal. From horrible service to terrible seafood...would never return. We waited a very long time for cocktails and order to be taken, when there was little crowd around in the restaurant. Then, our oyster order came out on a plate of water, not ice. They were small and shriveled up and warm. Next, the mussels in white wine sauce....hahahah. Um, no...it was more like garbage sewer sauce. Mussels were freezing COLD. Had to search for a server to get the check, took a long time again. Normally, I would complain right then and there for such terrible food and service but it was one of those days that was going so nicely that complaining about food would just ruin mine and my husband's infrequent night out without kids. I did feel strongly enough to write this review. How can a seafood place serve terrible seafood? I have never given a 0 star review and have worked in the food service industry. This place is terrible. Spend your money somewhere else."
"The wait staff looked like they were bussed in from a homeless shelter. The strange hostesses seated my party of 4, & it took 25 minutes to get our first beers. Ordered an app & left 25 minutes later, the lobster nachos never came, which sucked because I was quote excited about those. The place is gross! There was food & trash all over the floor & I watched several women exit the restroom with very disgusted looks on there face because the restroom was so nasty. This was confirmed by my wife. Skip this place & go anywhere else in the Strip District"
"Super disappointed in this place. Came here for a paint nite they were hosting and arrived over an hour beforehand to eat. All I ordered was soup and salad in order to be quick and my friends who ordered a lobster roll and shrimp got their food within 20 minutes. 40 minutes later, and ten minutes prior to painting I still had not received mine. On top of that, there was only one bartender working the whole top floor. When we told him I'd have to cancel my order to begin the event he began cursing about the staff at the restaurant- it was incredibly awkward. When the food arrived it was mediocre at best. Will not be coming back to this place unless I'm dragged."
"I think one star is being HIGHLY generous for this restaurant. My family and I visited Roland's on a Sunday afternoon for some lunch. It was by far the worst experience at a restaurant I have had. My husband and I both ordered the Lobster Rolls and I order my daughter pasta from the kids menu. It took the staff SO LONG to bring our lunch and when it finally came, my husband and I both got our sandwiches, but my daughter got nothing. Of course she was not happy about that at all, and trying to calm her down, we were giving her our food so that she had something, but she really wanted her pasta. My husband went to talk to the manager, and our server came over but STILL NO PASTA. 15-20 minutes later the pasta finally came out. And of course it was scalding hot. Not only was the pasta so hot that it was inedible (especially for a kid) there was a POOL of greasy butter and oil in the bottom of the bowl. I think my kid ate more of the grease than the actual pasta. It was DISGUSTING. This was such an absolutely horribly disappointment of a restaurant. Not to mention that the lobster roll was not even that great and definitely not worth $16. (Maybe it would have been better if it didn't sit on my plate for twenty minutes while I waited for my daughter's food). Don't waste your time here, especially if you have kids. The staff (minus our waitress who was really nice and it wasn't her fault) are a bunch of bozos."
"Ugh if I could give this place -10 stars I would. What a nightmare. To start, the first time I ate here, I almost swallowed a giant shard of plastic that was in my salad. Then to my horror, the bar tending goes ""whoops."" and tosses it on the floor!! Fast forward a couple months, I decide to give this place a second chance. (I must have been delirious from hunger.)First off the bar tender was rude, slow as hell and terrible at making drinks. My friend and myself order our food and 20 min later out comes my friends food. After almost an hour of waiting, I still had NO pizza. When I asked the cranky pants bar tender in the NICEST possible way, where it was, he just shrugged and walked away. I asked to speak to a manager and was told he was ""busy."" Finally someone came to talk to me and after an hour and a half I got my shitty pizza. Thank you to the kitchen manager for doing his job and coming to talk to the customer. But, to the bar tender working earlier New Year's Eve. You DO NOT DESERVE THIS JOB AND SHOULD BE FIRED."
"This place is less than mediocre. Visited on a Friday night and it was pretty crowded. We requested a high top near the bar and the hostess was very accommodating. The food was ""meh"". The clam chowder was just ok. I was excited for the lobster/artichoke pizza, but it was absolutely tasteless! Like, I was shocked by how much it tasted like nothing. I ended up slathering my clam chowder all over the pizza in an attempt to kick up the flavor. The pizza crust was good -thin and chewy just like I prefer. We also ordered the lobster roll sliders and the best thing about that dish was the Mancini bread.  Not worth the bucks. The service was slow-mo, but as I mentioned it was a crowded Friday night so it didn't bother me much. There were a few good beer selections on draft...so that's a plus. But I definitely won't return. Life is too short for less than mediocre food."
"Absolutely a waste of time and money. Service is just terrible. Wait staff was more focused on sweeping under our table while we were still seated, then pre bussing our table. The food was terrible and way overpriced. I never even had the opportunity to complain about my food because our server never asked. I'm leaving and my table is still covered in all of the dishes and empty beer glasses. Just awful."
"The ahi tuna contained sheets of sinewy, tough tissue that made it inedible. My uneaten tuna sat on my plate in front of me (during a group event) for more than an hour before the server removed it. There weren't enough staff so she simply was not able to ask anyone how the food was. The restaurant was too busy. The mashed potatoes were good."
"Terrible experience here. The food was way overpriced and tasted like overcooked slabs of meat. We ordered the mussels as an appetizer, a swordfish entree, and an ahi tuna entree. We got our appetizer, salads, and entrees at the same time and everything was cold. I don't know how you can manage to overcook food and then it's still cold, but that's what happened. The mussels were barely seasoned and were hardly edible. I never complain at restaurants, but our meals were so bad that we had to complain to the manager. Luckily, he appologized and took one of the entrees off. I can't believe how bad the food was and that they're charging so much for it. It was awful."
"Let's call this place for what it is: it's a racist establishment.3~4 bartenders going around the bar and exiting as if they were on a carnival ride.Taking care of everyone else and not once asked what I wantedHailed one of them for a drink. Didn't even offer a food menu.After three sips I asked for a food menu. Bartender nearly tosses it across the table.Paid for the lousy $6 beer and got up. The whole time the patron next to me was eyeing the whole situation as if expecting a bigger reaction from me.Asked for the manager and brought it to his attention. His response: ""oh, I had no idea, I apologize"""
"I used to be a frequent visitor of Roland's...the food was always good and the beer was always cold.....well not this particular Friday afternoon. I went there with a friend just after the lunch rush....we sat at the bar, because we a little short on time. There was only 1 bartender working so the service was a little slow. We ordered 2 beers and 2 fish sandwiches.......the beer was luke-warm....it came out of the tap with so much foam I could tell before he sat it down in front of me.....then he tried to argue the fact that the beer was warm.....NOT A GOOD START! He finally conceded to replace the beer with some that were a little colder (but not much) and gave a lame explanation to why the temp was not right, took our order and then we waited, and waited, and waited for about 45mins for our sandwiches to come out...... I want to say the fish was very hot, but it was also very greasy as if they fried it and then refried it then let it sit in the dirty brown grease...not to mention the fries were very cold. So after waiting another 15-20mins the bartender asked how is the food....of course we complained know we waited 15 more mins to talk the manager TIM.....he was snarky and sarcastic....when we told him the fish was greasy he returned with ""well it is fried in grease"".....DUH! TIM! we kinda knew that!......needless to say we did not finish our beer or our food....we went down the street to Wholey's and got a hot fish sandwich minus the grease."
I regretted coming here almost immediately. It took 10 minutes just to get our waters. All of our entrees came at different times. My friend ordered the seafood stew and the oysters were extremely chewy and nearly inedible. I had to spit the oyster out in a napkin. This is the first and last time I'm coming here.
"On a slow night it takes:20 minutes for water30 minutes for beer 60+ minutes for soup and raw entreesCome hungry, leave hungrier and bitter because you wasted time and money."
Not sure if it was the food but 2 of us in our party were sick after eating last night.  The only thing we ate that was different from the rest of our party was clam chowder.
"Waited to be seated for 15 minutes, no one greeted us. Asked a passing waitress if we seat ourselves. Waitress walked up the stairs and shouted out NO!  10 minutes later, same waitress passed by and again we asked if we could be seated. She walked up the stairs and ignored us. We asked totalk to the manager and she threw her arms up and said, if you can find him! Needless to say, we will not be returning to this place."
"Extremely disapointed, we signed our receipt for a total of $55 later to find out we were charged $88,  I guess our waitress needed the extra $30.  Never going back, letting our bank handle this one.  Would love to see the receipt copy we left again!"
"BEWARE Duquesne/Pitt families visiting or anyone else!   Awful food and service! Super slow, cold fries, freezer burned carrots, rubbery lobster claws. Wait, Ceasar salad was ok!  Who hunts down the server for 10 minutes to get the check! We could've just left without paying, but I believe in Karma. NO Stars!"
"Spending a beautiful day in the strip a few weeks ago culminated in a (what I'd hoped) was a quick stop at Roland's. Grab a beer, lobster roll and salad, and I'd be home before traffic. I was not so lucky. I arrived and was immediately sat by a waitress that appeared to be extremely overwhelmed by the five tables in the patio. There were a few guests at the bar, being entertained by the bartender. I should have gone and sat there, but it was so nice out, I decided to eat on the patio. My beer order was taken quickly, but then took twelve minutes to arrive. By that time, the head was gone, and it was losing it's cool. The waitress abruptly dropped off the beer and disappeared. I already knew what I was ordering, but she flitted around from table to table awkwardly for a good ten minutes until I made creepy eye contact with her and she shuffled my way. She took my order, and pretended to care about what I was ordering, but then disappeared again. Forty minutes later my poor lobster roll arrived. The fries were mushy, and the lobster roll took six (SIX!) napkins to sop up all the grease. I ate it, but I wasn't happy. About three bites in (and with the fastest response time of my dining experience) here comes awkward waitress again, asking if I needed anything else. I decided on another beer. She then proceeded to ask me if I minded if she smoked a cigarette before she grabbed my beer. (WHAT?!) No. Forget the beer. Bring me my check.  With no tip for awkward waitress, I left. Probably never to return.Happy Eating, just not here."
"I ate dinner here with a group to celebrate a friend's birthday.  My overall opinion is that the service was terrible and the food was overpriced.  Our drinks took 15-20 minutes to arrive.  We were drinking beers, so I'm not sure why it took so long.  We had to wait an extremely long time for our food, I would estimate at least 45 minutes.  We had ordered calamari and bruschetta for appetizers, but they were served with the entrees.  When we started to eat it became very obvious that our food had been sitting for a while.  Anyone who had french fries said they were cold.  I ordered the rosemary shrimp scampi, which came with mashed potatoes and a broccoli/carrot mix.  The mashed potatoes were lukewarm at best, and the vegetables were cold.  I ate the broccoli, but I don't like raw carrots so I didn't eat those.  It honestly looked like they just threw a handful of baby carrots onto the plate.  As for the shrimp itself, it tasted good but wasn't what I expected.  I was expecting a pasta-type dish, but it was just 5 or 6 pieces of shrimp in a garlic butter bath.  And I don't think a few pieces of shrimp and cold vegetables should cost $23, especially when I was still hungry after the meal.  To top it all off, we realized halfway into our meals that we were never given napkins.  We had to ask twice for them to be brought out.The only good thing about the experience was the beer selection.  If I ever come back here I will just stick to the bar and not waste my time or money on the food."
"Terrible tuxedo rentals! I went here 2 months before my good friend's wedding to get sized and order my tuxedo. The salesman who measured me did not know what he was doing, continued to ask someone else if he was 'doing it right' and made me extremely uncomfortable. At the moment I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt that he would get it right. When I picked it up, it did not fit!! They go through a third party and did not have an easy way to remedy the situation. They had to ship a replacement to where I was going since it was an out of town wedding. I had to return it to another Jos. A Bank store because I did not want to go back to the RPM location to see the guy that fit me originally. When I returned I wanted to see what they could do for my extreme amount of inconvenience and they hassled me when I wanted a refund! I was going to use them for my bridal party tuxedos next year, but no way now. All the employees there just said they go through a third party so its no wonder their rentals are not easier! Ha! POOR EXCUSE FOR A GENTLEMAN'S STORE. Oh, and its very very expensive!However, Jack from the RPM store was very kind and helped to make a bad situation better."
"The owner, Nicholas G Nicholas needs to attend a few driving classes before he kills someone. Maybe too much hp for him. If you see an 08 white porsche with FL plate 917 MNC stay clear. Guy drives like a nut. Almost ran me off the road in Boca Raton by 95."
"Rude. That's the first word that comes to mind. When my fiancÌ© and I came into town I was excited to see what looks like a small interesting coffee shop. And that about sums it up.... it looks that way. When you walk in you are hit with delicious aromas of coffee. They have lots of interesting treats and teas. I was so excited while standing in line. Then the service. First, the girl at the register practically threw the man ahead of us back his credit card. He didn't make a comment but I thought, rude. When it was our turn I asked for a cappuccino and questioned what kind of milk they have. She responded ""uh, 2%"" like I was stupid (rude) then the guy behind her said ""anything you want really"" (not so rude) and so I asked for a whole milk cappuccino. What I received  was a whole milk latte. It's a coffee shop at least get the drink craft down. I can't drink the amount of milk in lattes. I didn't order a latte. So I walked back apologized for being ""that person"" and asked for a whole milk cappuccino less hot so I can drink it right away. She said ""fine"" (Rude). She made me a 2% cappuccino scalding hot. Was it decaf? I don't know but I wouldn't put it past her. As she handed it to me she said in a condescending tone ""this should be enough foam for you"".The foam was light and airy. Very pretty. But this isn't what I ordered. I burnt my tongue. And am not a fan of the 2%. Rude. So very rude. All I wanted was caffeine and a good experience. I will NEVER come back here."
"I have been here several times in the last year. The food is average...kind of fast-food-like. It sits in the warmer cases, and looks ""crusty"". The gyros are average, not as good as the ones at the South Side gyro restaurant, by any means.  The salads are from a bag of pre-chopped lettuce, and not ""fresh"" or interesting. But in order to enjoy the average food, you have to get past the really rude food wait staff.  The bartenders seem to be OK, the clientele in the bar seem to be regulars, and it is a ""cheap drink"" attraction to some downtown locals. The staff that serves the food, and takes the orders are out of this world rude. There is one that wins the prize for insulting the customers, and after having endured her, I will never, ever return. Owners should know how they are being represented at the front register. The man that cooks and plates the food is oblivious, or just is used to hearing her speak to people with such a lack of respect, that he is just deaf to it. Go somewhere else. It is cheap food, and you get what you pay for. I would pay twice as much, to feel like the staff gave a crap that I was there supporting their jobs."
It was very cold inside the restaurant. I had the posieden salmon and the filo dough was so tough I couldn't cut it my plastic fork. My husbands pork was a small portion. It was very inexpensive and I understand why. Won't go back or recommend it.
"Sucks.  I walked across thd bridge, in the rain, got there before closing but the doors were already locked.  Why post a closing time if it isn't honored?"
"Sorry, but I stopped in this morning to get my lunch because I knew I would be too busy to go out for lunch.  Got a Greek Salad.  First of all, there was no lid on the salad, it was wrapped in plastic wrap... What??? Anybody could put anything in there without too much trouble.  Second when I went to eat it, I threw most of it away because the lettuce was brown and/or wilted.  Not going back again.  I didn't spend all that money for garbage."
"Um, so I don't think anyone else has experienced this, but when I went to order with the woman at the counter, she smelled strongly of alcohol and didn't seem very coherent.  She didn't know what the specials were and asked me to tell her what they were which I found extremely odd.  The whole situation was alarming so I decided to put back the water I was holding and go to the Crazy Mocha in the same building instead.  I'm not sure what is going on with this place, but it seems like they need to change their staff.  This was my first time trying Brown Bag Deli too."
"This was one of the most disgusting restaurants ive ever been in.  First decided to sit inside.  There were nats flying all over the place.  So, I decided to sit outside as i had already ordered my food.  However, there were bugs all over the outside patio as well (probably from the standing water with plastic flowers in them).  I ordered a hummus and pita (which they made me think was free but charged me for) a glass of wine, and a chicken kabob.  The food was decent at best.  Then, I go to check out, my dinner was $25.  Better yet the cook who was checking me out had the nastiest yellow finger nails i have ever seen.  I thought i was going to throw up but i was too motivated to get out of there."
"I hated it! First, when I reach there the server showed me a table at the door. I asked for another location because it was cold... His answer.... Why? followed with an arrogant face!!! OK!!!! We finally sited in another place.... The salad came... It was ok... Nothing special... The entree... Please.... I can cook better... The lamb was sooo ordinary... Since I was in Pittsburgh for a meeting, I ask to the same old ""gentleman"" that was serving us for a itemized ticket ( to be reimbursed by university). Whole sh....!!!! His answer: this is the receipt, I can give you nothing else! You can write by yourself what you ate and show to them.... The only restaurant that gave me so rude, unprofessional answer ever!!!! It is not everything... I just took my things and I was moving out when the same ""gentleman"" say loud: THE TIP WAS NOT INCLUDE!!!! Oh my god.... Should I really tell him how much he deserved? But, I took a deep breath and some bucks from my pocket, and give to him... Saying sorry with my mouth, but shov.... it!!!! With my eyes!!!! Please, if you go to there... Cross the street, you find a nice Indian cuisine. Five steps ahead, Cambodian. Three steps back, a nice cafe. Better, Six Penn at the corner..."
"Okay so this place was a pretty big disappointment.  The hummus was extremely watery and barely had any hummus flavor.  The pita served with it was definitely store bought.  I ordered the lamb kabobs which were greasy on the outside and had spices just slapped on them like they were going to flavor the lamb magically, but it ended up tasting like chewy, undercooked lamb with a bunch of spice on the outside.  They salad served before the meal too was awful.  It had wilted iceberg lettuce with one kalamata olive, a handful of tomatoes, barely any cucumbers and loads of a flavorless dressing.  Basically just don't go here."
This place looked hopeful for authentic Mediterranean but the food just didn't live up to any expecation. Do yourself a favor and go next door to Cafe Milano.
"This place was really gross.  There was no one around when we went in, but we were starving.The food wasn't fresh, the dishes were dirty, and I felt like I was going through Pan's Labyrinth to get to the bathroom, which was pretty far away, seemingly in another dimension.  It was almost an adventure.There was old black slimy greens in my salad, but at least the watermelon in the salad was good!  I'll give them that!  The olives were even disgusting--how do you mess up olives?  The spanokopita was limp and oily and devoid of much phyllo.  And there were copious bugs flying around our food the whole time we dined.  When we paid, the cashier asked how much of a tip we wanted to leave, and added it directly to the bill  instead of giving us the opportunity to leave our own tip or write it on the restaurant receipt.  The bill was way too high.If you really hate someone, you should take them to this restaurant."
"Dirty, unclean, my friend and I went to lunch here.  She went to go to the bathroom. Upon returning to the table had the following story to tell.  To get to the bathroom she had to go through the kitchen and down a flight a stairs. When passing through the kitchen she saw raw chicken left out in the heat congealing in it's own blood.  Christos you get no second chances after a stunt like that.  The food was tasty, but come on now chicken chillen on the counter is a no go in anyone's kitchen."
"The food was clearly microwaved (ie the ring around the soup bowl and splatters along the sides). The fish was rubbery. The wait staff, although nice, was very salesy always trying to ""add on"" something in a pushy way. I asked for my check and barely ate anything. I think the waiter got his ego bruised because he decided to display his ""Best In City"" award right behind my head as I was still sitting at the table... a shame the award was from 2005! I guess a lot changed in 7 years?Don't bother with this place!"
"Christos was one of the worst experiences I've ever had while dining in Pittsburgh. They call this a Greek restaurant but they don't even have a normal gyro on the menu. My boyfriend and I decided to split the platter, which was horrible. The gyro meat wasn't off the spick, the dolmades were the worst thing ever eaten in my life and they charged us 4.00 to split it which we didn't even ask for in the first place. The only pleasant thing about this place was the cook who ended up serving us our food after our waiter went out for what seemed like a drug deal. Over all, everything was bad and I would never return and would advice everyone else to do the same."
"So....I read the reviews on Yelp & Urban Spoon.Mostly negative, but hey I was hungry and gave it a shot.It's true the place is dingy & like entering a Greek grandfather's home. I was first asked  if I wanted huumus. I declined that after reading is was mediocre at best. So I tried the $5.25 saganaki. It came out in an old brown dish with what looked like rubber floating in lemon juice and oil. * The owner failed to mention the pita bread was extra.It tasted WORSE than it looked (if that was possible). Tough cheese mostly tasteless and chewy. * I have had many saganaki in various countries. This ranked as one of the VERY worst! I made the best decision to leave before food poisoning set in. Bottom line:  HORRIFIC !!!"
"WARNING. DO NOT GO HERE.My family was visiting my sister in Pittsburgh and we had our eyes set on a specific restaurant, not Christos. A gentleman, I presume the owner of Christos, saw my family and I as we walked down the street. He flashed us his menu, pitching to us why his restaurant was the best and why his food was the best. I could barely tell if he was selling food or used cars. I kindly told him we were not interested. My family, however, was indecisive when it came to getting a restaurant. We ending up wanting to go eat at the restaurant next door to Christos so we backtracked. Again the owner flashed us his menu, sensing our touristy indecision. I again declined and pointed to the restaurant I was heading to. He then ignored me and pan-handled to my two sisters, mother and wife. They gave in to my dismay. As they said ""sure..."" I looked inside the restaurant of Christos at peak dinner hours.  No one was inside.  Absolutely no one. As my family walked in and I rolled my eyes, I thought, well let's give them a chance...my whole family seemed to feel bad for the guy and I like Greek food.As we got in, it seemed nothing was going on. We had just came back from kayaking so we needed to wash our hands. They didn't seem to have a restroom but they took my sisters and mother through the kitchen and downstairs to find one. The silence was broken when they finally put music on and suddenly a couple of kitchen helpers came out and looked like they were warming some of the kitchen equipment up.  Were we their only customers tonight? I bet we were. Before I could settle in, he casually asked if I liked pita and hummus. Obviously I said yes. He was asking me so casually when I didn't even have a menu, I assumed it was complimentary when he said he would get me some, but as I waited I found his restaurant on Yelp with my phone and the first review gave them one star and mentioned how the owner didn't tell him the pita was extra.  Great. The rest of my family later came back from the restroom (akin to going to a restroom at a grocery store where you're around stock items...except you need to go through their kitchen). They started with salad. The waiter asked if I wanted anchovies or something else on my salad. I was going to say ""sure"" but my wife stopped me and said it could be extra. The waiter, looking like he got caught, verified he was offering all extras to me even though earlier the owner said salads came with dinner. I had to say,""I just want the standard salad, nothing extra."" I couldn't let my guard down.We ordered some food, priced about what you'd expect.  The pita and hummus I ordered earlier was just barely average so I don't know why they thought it was worth $4. My sister ordered ""leg of lamb"" so I expected to see a leg of a lamb. Instead when her plate came out, it looked like sad slices of ham. Really. We all got vegetables but they were soggy and unappetizing. I saw them earlier in the kitchen sitting in a big pot when I had used the restroom. Nothing here is fresh. My lamb was on the chewy side. My sister's ""leg of lamb"" was left uneaten and she asked if I wanted some. I ""tried"" to eat it but it was too chewy. They then asked for dessert. I wanted to say no out of my discontent but again my family members all said yes, even when they were telling me the food was not great.  I don't have their sense of pity. The desert and salad were the best things of the night, which was kind of sad. When we got the receipt and my wife insisted we check it.  Surprise. They overcharged us $7 from two mysterious items. Their receipt doesn't even list what you ordered. I went up the the cashier to ask them what the two items were. He tried to explain one but he really couldn't. He scratched out the $3 item. I then questioned the $4 charge. Again he tried to explain it but he really couldn't. Again he agreed with me and scratched out the $4.  On top of all this we still gave them a normal tip out of pity. I could tell the waiters were just following orders. I could tell the owner had trained them what to say and how to make extra money.You've been warned. There's a reason why this place is doing so poorly.  There's a reason why the whole hour between 7:30pm and 8:30pm we were the only ones in the restaurant. There's a reason why the owner is begging customer to come in. They're cutting corners on customer service and food quality in exchange for salesman tactics, overcharging and tricking you to buy things you don't even know is extra. DO NOT GO HERE.Owners like this will say,""But I have to or else I won't make it."" You know what? Restaurants like yours shouldn't make it. Not to be harsh but it was a poor experience. Change your food, your sales tactics and your fake receipt items strategy. Maybe a long time ago when they started they were real but now they are doing every dirty trick in the book to nickel and dime you.  WARNING. DO NOT GO HERE."
"This place is something STRAIGHT out of a David Lynch film. It felt like I was transported to some sort of alternate reality with the help of a smiling, and overbearing greek man outside a restaurant door preying on the weak and indecisive. Something in the air of this place comes off as so fundamentally strange, and almost, discomforting and nightmare-like. You are going to feel uneasy, is what I'm trying to say. - They overcharged us, probably intentionally. They don't have itemized receipts. - The waiter kept giving us options as if they were... free options that you're supposed to choose. We caught on when we specifically asked if they cost extra.- The elusive bathroom felt like we were descending down the staircase to hell. Better than nothing, I suppose.- The food.... oh my god. None of our food was good. In fact most of it was outright gross/uneatable. The hummus was decent, but... I can also get decent hummus at Trader Joe's. We initially felt bad for these guys. A struggling business is always sad to see. But with all of the strange behavior, attempts to scam us, etc. that sympathy turned into a sense of understanding as to why this place isn't doing so well. If the owners are reading this-- I'm sorry if my review came off harsh.. but really, please, rethink the way you are going about your business. I don't want you to fail, I want you to overcome this. Do it the right way, not the scummy way. I know you're trying, but try differently."
"If you like rotting salad, rude staff, greasy food, stupid stories about Jackie Onassis and her favorite dessert then this is the place for you. Absolutely terrible. I cannot say a single good thing about this place, it's just tough to figure out how they remain in business."
"Food lacked flavor for every course. Service was very bad even though only 2 tables were being served at the time. The leg of lamb was flavorless strips of low grade meat, maybe lamb. Waiter will try and hard sell at every interaction throughout the meal."
"I have no idea why this place is considered a 'pittsburgh staple' restaurant. I have been there a few times for corporate events, and the service is always lacking and the food is just tasteless, terrible, and slightly expensive for how processed everything seems. Its like they buy everything from cans and don't even care enough to spice it up a bit. The building itself is pretty, and it does have a bar, but for promoting itself as a fine Italian food restaurant, I really their style is missing something."
"Why come to this place when you have a tasty world of Italian restaurants right at your hungry fingers in this town!The place is essentially a tourist-trap that seeks to reel in folks who are looking for a ""fun"" looking italian warehouse (now...how would this be fun? Apparently it is to some.)Don't get me wrong...the food is not atrocious. But it certainly is sub-par. My chicken parm was quite un-tasty and seemed as if the spaghetti had come out of a can. The service was mediocre.Keep driving to Bloomfield!"
"We have been coming here since it opened, but will not go back after our three last visits. It has gone downhill badly. Three visits ago we were seated in the trolley and then completely ignored for 30 minutes. There was a waitress, but apparently she was new and only had the front half. I finally went out front and demanded the manager who finally assigned a waitress for us and comp'ed our meals. The lasagna was very disappointing with hard noodles and definitely not oven baked and barely warm.Two visits ago to use the gift cards we intended to use on the previous visit, service was poor and food was fair.The last visit last night was the third strike and SW is OUT! Very poor service and food. The drinks were all ice and refills were not timely. The server past our table many times, but she flew by each time like we were not there. The zucchini appetizer was good. We only got one loaf of bread which was barely done and came with almost no butter. No ranch dressing...really! This is the Strip District after all with many stores for crying out loud. The food was very poor. The spaghetti and meatballs had about a tablespoon of sauce. The fetticini alfredo was almost devoid of sauce, as well. My Wild Mushroom and Chicken was not warm but tasted okay. We will NOT be going back. Olive Garden and Bravos in the North Hills will be getting our business from now on."
"Didn't think this was possible, but it's worse than Olive Garden...food was horrible and extremely overpriced, service was decidedly lacking....  Neat location with fun and interesting decor but I wouldn't eat there again."
"I never thought that standard Italian Food was hard to make. As I alway say it doesn't take a rocket scientist to boil noodles and open a jar of pasta sauce and grate some cheese. For years this place has been touted as a diamon in the ruff in an area of the strip that has since built up greatly over the last 20 years. I had gone in the past but most recently decided to visit again because of their 'no coupon lunch special' advertised in the Sunday paper and also in the Red Plum coupon section. It was around $5 for Spaghetti Marinara a salad and what they call fresh baked bread. Let me say the spaghetti came out in a bowl with alot of tomato chunks and what looked like some raw oregano shaken on top. The noodles (from a box, definately not fresh pasta) were room temperature along with a quite a bit of water that settled to the bottom of the bowl from the sauce seperating. I would honestly rather have had Ragu Robusto from a jar instead of this particular sauce. It tasted like stomach acid, was sour and had not texture to it. The oregano flavor was overbearing and quite off putting. The salad was as described in the review below mine, watery iceberg with brown edges and some dressing spooned on top. We ended up eating alot of bread since nothing else was appetizing. The first one came out warm and the second one was cold and a bit hard. I am going to take a wild guess and say that the bread loaves are made off site and come in a plastic bag inside a giant box such as brown and serve rolls. You can tell they are placed in some type of convection oven to be heated slightly before they serve it to you. It's pretty much a crap shoot if you get a warm one or not. With the special price, tax & tip and depending on if you buy a beverage or not you end up paying about $7 to $9 per person anyway. Not sure if this is your idea of a cheap lunch but at home I can make this meal from about $2 per person and it is always way better. Do yourself a favor and go out and buy some fresh pasta at one of the stores in the Strip, touch up one of your favorite jar sauces with a little Italian sausage, buy a bag of butter lettuce and some salad dressing from Aldi and a fresh loaf of Mancinis bread at your local supermarket and have a feast, save your money by not frequenting places like this."
"Yes-the food is good and the portions are big.  Our waiter was very speedy and attentive.  That being said, I cannot ever go back to this place again because of the amount of bugs I saw in such a short period of time.  All gnats and thankfully nothing worse but who knows what's going on in the kitchen?  Not just a stray gnat or two but dozens just swarmed our table.  I killed one with my bare hand on the table and another one bit me and drew a (spec) of blood. Disgusting. A ""manager"" (looked like a bus boy if you ask me but what do I know) did come to talk to us about it after my waiter noticed me covering my food with my napkin but it didn't accomplish much, no free meal or anything.  I noticed other people moving to other parts of the restaurant to avoid these bugs too."
"The food is horrible - how can you serve pasta and marinara sauce and not even toss the pasta in the sauce?  I truly received a pile of watery noodles with a ladle of sauce on top.Actually, the name says it all.  While this place has an italian food menu, there isn't an italian bone in its body.  You feel as if you are being served italian food from an irish line cook.The restaurant decor was really nice when they last decorated it in 1981, which was also the last time that they updated the menu."
"There has to be better Italian food in Pittsburgh -- I don't know why anyone would come here.I had an overnight field trip with my students to Pittsburgh & the tour company took us here for a murder mystery dinner show.  They had us sectioned off which was great for privacy & also since the students were loud.Their service is a hot mess!!!!  They only had 2 waiters serving our 50 person group & it was not organized at all.  Just getting our drinks out was confusing.  The waiters just came out with any drink & then asked -- anyone order this??  This is why my table sat drinkless, breadless, & saladless for the longest time.For our dinner, we were given a salad, entree, & tiramisu.  The salad was definitely straight out of the bag & doused with some cheap dressing.  It didn't taste fresh at all.  There was a list of 8 or so entrees we could choose from.  They came out quite haphazardly.  I unfortunately ordered the fettuccine alfredo -- worst ever.  I could make better alfredo using the sauce from a supermarket jar.  I tried to douse it with pepper & cheese but alas it did nothing to help it.  Some of the others said the chicken parm was alright but some said theirs was undercooked.  The tiramisu also was gross.  It definitely was made & cut awhile ago & just kept cold in their fridge.The redeeming parts of this dinner was the decor & old fashioned coin operated games AND the mystery show.  I've never been to one & was really excited.  They started after we ate our entrees & intermissioned during dessert.  The actors were super funny & interactive -- my students loved them which of course makes me happy.  Seriously though, their food is so bad."
"Came here later in the evening on a weekday to an empty building. No host/ess, no wandering servers, no customers... We had to search the place for someone to seat us and the first people we ran into were a couple of off-duty servers who were rolling silverware. The male kindly sat us and got our drinks for us. It took a ridiculously long time for our server to even appear at our table and just as long for our food to come out. To make everything worse, the only other couple in the restaurant who were sitting behind us were complaining to the server about their food. The server returned to their table a bit later (no manager) and said that ""the manager"" told him that since the food is made early in the day, it can lose texture and flavor by the time it is served. WHAT? Seriously???? It was hard to enjoy our food at all by the time it arrived.The food left much the be desired. The service was the worst I've ever encountered. I don't usually leave complaints on restaurant websites but I had to leave one for this terrible visit. They gave us a coupon for a free appetizer. Needless to say we did not return to redeem it."
"This was the first time my husband and I have been here. We went with my sister-in-law, her boyfriend, and his sister as it is a tradition to go around Christmas for the boyfriend's family. Well, we were not impressed at all. Even the bf wasn't happy this time. We didnt have the best waitress as she would run off too quickly.for us to say much and we thought forgot about us the drinks took so long. She finally showed and said she had dropped them and had to make them again. We ordered and the wait wasn't too terribly bad for the food being a Saturday night in Pittsburgh though it was after 7 when we arrived. I didn't care much for.the garlicky butter that came with the sourdough, but the bread was hot and fresh.A balloon artist came around and made a flamingo that had to be 4 feet tall for the bf's sister and a little penguin for the SIL. He later came back, unasked, and gave her a 2 ft penguin with a hockey stick and puck in its ""hands'. We finally got our soup, which did take a while to come out. Three of.us had the wedding soup and none of us liked it. The SIL's bf said it didn't even taste like wedding soup, but like chicken soup with meatballs. Granted I've been a little stuffy lately, but the broth barely tasted like wedding soup broth to me either.I had the fettucine alfredo, which was ok. I ate more of it than I might have were I not eating for two right now.  I added pepper because it was rather plain...not even a garnish. My husband said his spaghetti and meatballs was just ok. The bf had ordered an Italian Margarita I believe it was called and drank the first one though it wasn't mixed right as you could taste the tequila and there was no salt. He even added sugar trying to improve it. The second he gave back and the waitress didn't even apologize or take it off the bill. She went into the kitchen and started complaining loudly and our table was near the kitchen. Then she shows up with the check and we had to wait for her to come back to split it 3 ways since there was 2 couples and one other at the table. The bad drink was still there and my SIL was thoroughly pissed by then and went to talk to the manager and told him about overhearing her and all he did was take the one drink off. I noticed while reading our check that the entrees were correct, but that she had us as having a salad and minestrone when we both had wedding soup. I didn't say anything since the price was the same.The balloons artist was great, but we won't be going back just to see him."
"This place is dead, but they just don't know it yet.  Arrived on a rainy Wednesday around 7PM.  20 minute wait for a table, so I guess they are doing well, right?  We should have known better when we sat in the bar area to wait (me, my spouse, and my eight-year-old son) after the rather apathetic front-desk person took our name.  A couple tables taken, but no sign of staff in the bar.  Every table was dirty, covered with plates, glasses, and the remains of others.  We took one that had just a couple of glasses and an impressive amount of Parmesan cheese scattered about.  Took 10 minutes for any sign of a bartender, who promptly spent five minutes getting caught up on drink orders before wandering over.  No smile, no welcome, just ""what do you want, and are you waiting for a table"".  And certainly no ""let me clean this table for you"".  We had a beer and a wine and a root beer for the little one.  The pinot grigio was vile, but, hey, thanks for charging us for the more expensive version: lord knows how disgusting the cheaper version would have been.   Finally, after 20 minutes we were seated.  Not a table in the bar area had been cleaned in that period.And the restaurant is empty!  Maybe 20% full!  They made us wait simply because they can't staff correctly.  Acres of empty tables.  So we sit, look at the menu, check out the surrounding (few) tables and made the only good decision we made this night:  we left and found another place in the area.  A place that actually worked to seat us and made us feel welcome.The most amazing thing:  between the greeter, the bartender, and the seater, there was not a single smile.  Not a single sign that they actually are happy that we chose their establishment.  And not a sign that that they gave a damn whether we ever wanted to come back.  No wonder it is 80% empty but still makes people wait.The other reviews compare this to Olive Garden and the like.  As my review makes clear, I can't compare the food.  And I am certainly not a fan of the Olive Garden.  But the few times I have gone into one, I was made to feel welcome.  Certainly not here.  The place is living off memories:  I don't think it is creating any new (positive) ones."
"I went to the Spaghetti Warehouse on a Sunday afternoon.   It was for a late lunch (about 2:00 p.m. when we arrived).  We were greeted by the hostess who took us to our table (which was in the trolley car).  It's a visually interesting place to dine.  However, our chairs were rickety and appeared ready to collapse. The restaurant was mostly empty (which was not a surprise as we got there after the prime lunch hour but before dinner).  And yet although there wasn't a lot of other customers there all vying for the attention of the servers, it took an unusually long time for our waitress to arrive at our table.  (A pattern which continued throughout the duration of our stay).   On the back of the menu, there is a section for lunch entrees.  I ordered the ""Amazing 15 Layer Lasagne"".   The three other people in my party all ordered the spaghetti with meatballs.   The food was...okay.  Nothing to write home about.  I've been eating Italian food for almost five decades.  And this is average - at best.  I'd say on par or slightly below Olive Garden.  It wasn't the worst food, but certainly not the best.  And again, I cannot overemphasize how below par the service was.   But the thing which really upset me was when we got our check.  They charged us dinner prices for each of our meals.   Again, there is ONE menu, and the pack of the menu has the lunch section.  It reads (until 3:00 p.m.).   What I failed to see (because it's in fine print) is the part where they only offer lunch prices Monday through Friday.   Really?  REALLY?   Are you kidding me?   That's B.S., no matter how you view it.  At no time did either the hostess or the waitress bother to explain to us up front that the lunch pricing wasn't in effect.   I HATE being ripped off.  And any restaurant which does that kind of crap is RIPPING PEOPLE OFF.   So congratulations, Spaghetti Warehouse.  You got the better of me.  And I will never, ever go there again."
"I wanted to like it here... in fact, I have in the past. We used to come here for college events and schedule ahead of time for a large group - then again, this was always on weeknights... when they were slow... thank goodness. I always loved the food here (then again, these dishes aren't anything scientific - they are basic - comfort food), and I thought the gigantic restaurant could handle large groups well... until I brought 10 people here for a birthday dinner on a Saturday. First of all, we had reservations but still stood awkwardly in the waiting area for a while to be seated. Not terrible. Then we were seated - the server was flustered and irritated before we had a chance to speak. Long story short, we waited 1.5 hours for our food (pasta... yes - the stuff you make at home for an entire family in 10 minutes), the waitress spent all her time coming to her table bashing the kitchen staff to us (not exactly professional), and the manager was no where to be seen. C'mon, manager! It's your job to sail this ship - get it together. From my line of vision, I could see about 7 servers running around like chickens with their heads cut off doing nothing but throwing the kitchen staff under the bus. Dear manager: if you have this many employees standing around doing nothing but complaining, put a few of them to work in the kitchen. The place is cute and I really want to like it again, but I probably won't return until the management learns how to... manage. True, this isn't Capital Grill, nor was I expecting 5-star service. In all honesty, I'm from the middle-of-nowhere Ohio. I didn't even know what fine dining was until college. It's just that I've had better service at Arby's on a Friday at 12 noon when they have a line 20 people deep and cars wrapped around the building 3 times in the drive-thru. Saving grace: the sangria was good... thankfully, because that's the only thing we consumed for 90 minutes while waiting on our luke-warm dinners to arrive."
"We came to spaghetti warehouse because it used to be a great restaurant 4-5 years ago. The evening we visited we had not made a reservation so we expected to have a little wait. When we walked up to the host's counter, we noticed the bar was empty. There were three hostesses behind the counter talking with who we assumed to be the manager. When the manager walked away, one hostess picked up a ringing phone while the other two stood there staring anywhere but at us. When the hostess finally got off the phone, she did not greet us, we had to ask if there was a wait and how long. When we were told there was a 45 min wait, we had to ask if the bar was available (the information was not offered to us). The hostess said yes and handed us menus and pointed up the stairs- she did not show us where to go. We then sat down and waited another 10min to get service from the bar staff- she seemed to be the only one working at the bar on this busy night. We wanted to be easy on the girl because she was apparently alone behind the bar, but she was very rude. It took about 35-40 min for our food to come out. The chicken tasted like frozen grilled out-of-a-bag chicken and the ""wild mushroom creams sauce"" was condensed cream of mushroom soup. The pesto my boyfriend ordered was drowning in olive oil. I would like to say this was an unusually bad night, however when I saw several waiters and waitresses gabbing and paying little attention to customers, it's hard to believe it was a one time thing. At one point a waiter stopped and stood watching the football game that was on the tv for about 8-10min. Needless to say, we will not be giving warehouse another chance."
"Arrived at 7:15 on a Saturday night, there was a 20 minute wait although although empty tables were visible.  Got seated at 7:30, put order in shortly thereafter.  We got bread and our soups fairly quickly then sat for an hour without any signs of food.  We looked around the restraint and it was obvious other tables had been waiting and we're getting frustrated.  The waitress apologized the kitchen was slow, so we gave it another 15 minutes before we finally walked out at 9:15 still hungry.  The food I saw looked good, but I would never recommend this place.  It doesn't take over an hour and a half to make a friggin salad and pasta."
"This is a one time visit. The worst service ever. It was almost empty and twice we had to have someone find our waitress. The food was mediocre at best. The bruschetta appetizer for 4.99 had 4 tiny pieces of bread with some tomatoes on top. Not even shaved cheese, nothing. Total waste of money. The lasagna that they claim is so great in my opinion was diner quality, and that might insult some great diners."
"We came to spaghetti warehouse (09/13) because it USED to be a great restaurant. The evening we visited we had not made a reservation so we expected to have a little wait. There were some people waiting in the lobby, and what appeared to be a birthday party happening in the dining room. When we walked up to the host's counter, we noticed the tables at the bar were empty. There were three hostesses behind the counter talking with who we assumed to be the manager. When the manager walked away, one hostess picked up a ringing phone while the other two stood there staring anywhere but us. When the hostess finally got off the phone, she did not greet us in any way, we had to ask if there was a wait and for how long. When we were told there was a 45 min wait, we had to ask if the bar was available (she did not offer this option). The hostess said ""yes"" and handed us menus and pointed up the stairs toward the bar- she did not show us where to go. After sitting down, we then waited another 10min to put in our drink order. The woman waiting on us seemed to be the only one working in the bar area on this busy night. We wanted to be easy on the girl because she was apparently alone behind the bar, but she was very rude. After waiting 10min to put in our drink order, it then took another 10min to get our drinks. It took about 40 min for our food to come out. The chicken tasted like frozen out-of-a-bag grilled chicken and the ""wild mushroom cream sauce"" was condensed cream of mushroom soup (My boyfriends pesto was swimming in olive oil). I would like to say this was an unusually bad night, however when I saw several waiters and waitresses gabbing and paying little attention to customers, it's hard to believe it was a one time thing. At one point a waiter stopped and stood watching the football game that was on the tv for about 8-10min. The only think I liked were the women's restrooms- they were nice and clean. Needless to say, we will not be giving warehouse another chance. Summary: Awful service, terrible food, nice bathrooms. I would rather go to Olive Garden than here!"
"I went here after seeing a musical and it was terrible.  My sister and I ordered the Seafood Mediterraneo, which is supposed to have clams and shrimp in a creamy sauce.  There was only one shrimp in mine and the sauce wasdefinitely not what I call creamy.  My sister sent hers back because it was cold.  I was starved so tried some of mine as still a little warm.  The place is old and outdated, and the restrooms were horrible.  Save your money and make spaghetti at home!  Not the same nice place with delicious food that I remember from 15-20 years ago."
"A long long time ago in a far away place, I used to go to a place called Spaghetti Warehouse that was cool, clean, had good service, and had really good food. But that place is gone and now I'm left at this place that is dirty, has horrible service, and mediocre food. The end. Never coming back."
"No, nope, uh uh, no way, please don't call this an Italian restaurant. Overcooked, mushy noodles, watery tomato gravy, and meatballs that are too garlicky and over spiced. Can't give this place anything lower than 1 star. Seriously, Olive Garden is a joke and I rate it higher than this place. Again, my advice to any Italian food lover, find a good neighborhood, family owned restaurant and support a family and not a conglomerate."
Took two and a half hours to get our food. All our food was the thrown together in the same pan. Not worth the $55.
"Ordered delivery. The food showed up 2.5 hours later-which is acceptable, as it's (just) within the delivery window specified. However, the food had apparently been prepared within 15 minutes of receiving our order, because it was cold by the time we got it. I didn't listen to the other reviews and paid the price (literally)... if someone else is saved a crappy SW dinner by this review, my meal (or lack thereof) will not have been in vain."
Worst place ever.  I took my friend there for the first time and my son.  We waited a hour for food.  The waiter got us out water not our sangria  30 min later out salads and after  another 40 min of my kid begging for his pizza we decided to go.  The reason they messed up the order.  We talked to the manager I'm assuming which didn't really care.  Said hopefully we come back because service isn't usually this bad. Never again. Unprofessional and rude
"Ewww, the food here is terrible.  Nothing I had tasted good.  It tasted like it had been sitting under the food warmers for hours.  The service is luke warm at best.  Just skip it.  There's so many other places out there for good italian food."
"We went here with sixteen people. The only good thing about our visit was having dinner with a bunch of our friends. The service was pretty good to considering the large party. My wife and I got the Sicilian Sampler Appetizer and The Ultimate Feast for two, as our dinner entree. The Calamari was uneatable and the Ravioli was just down right nasty. The wedding soup was the worst I have ever had. The meat balls had absolute no taste, kind of like cardboard. The Pork Sausage tasted burnt. The Spaghetti tasted no different than Boxed pasta. The Lasagna might have had 15 layers but 12 of them were noodles and sauce, you had to search for any meat or cheese. Our garlic bread came out literally black. I can't even believe somebody would serve that. We will not be back."
"I stopped in here with my family the day before Thanksgiving. My sister, niece, and parents were at the Children's Museum and were struck by a fit of nostalgia--my mom used to take us here when we were kids. Either the whole operation has gone severely downhill, or I was too young to notice how bad it all is.Between all of us, we ordered chicken Alfredo, lasagna, and cheese ravioli. Every dish had several things wrong with it. The chicken was likely cooked the week before in a dirty cafeteria then shipped to the Strip District. It was dry and looked reconstituted. The ravioli were lukewarm at best, and my sister said the lasagna tasted microwaved. Even the bread was stale.Our waitress was also forgetful and a bit cold. I didn't get a salad I ordered, dishes stayed on the table fifteen or twenty minutes after being empty, and water refills were inconsistent. As a former server myself, I'd like to think I know what is in one's control and what is out of one's control. This woman was simply not up to snuff.With Lidia's right down Smallman Street, I have no idea how the Warehouse is staying in business. Spend a few extra dollars and go there. It'll be worth it."
I am having a difficult time determining which is worse the Spaghetti Warehouse or the Olive Garden.  Mushy spaghetti drenched in the worst sauce I ever had.  Ok on second thought the Olive Garden is better.
"I wish it were possible to give this place 0 stars. I ate here twice, hated the food both times, and felt like I was in a bizzaro funhouse instead of a restaurant. They clearly thing that if they go for the most ridiculous decor they can imagine it will distract from their lousy food. They're wrong."
"The pasta is consistently overcooked. The service is not only poor, but the staff are rude. I will not visit this restaurant again. I'm not Italian, but I cook way better than this myself."
"We've eaten a number of superb meals at the Morton's in Cincinnati, and were eagerly looking forward to a sumptious dinner at Morton's in Pittsburgh. Oh boy. The ambiance is more like a Wendy's that tries to be upscale: cramped, busy, somewhat noisy. Of the two filet mignons we had (different sizes, medium rare) one was horribly overcooked, the other one a little on the rare side. The meat wasn't special. The deserts were OK but the Creme Brulee was bland in the extreme. Service was OK but occasionally inattentive. For two adults, one child, a check of $150 would have been reasonable for the quality provided. It ended up being $350 or so. Oh well - I rounded up the check to $400 and left with the intention of never coming back again. Imagine my shock when I found that my credit card had been charged with $600! I'm sure this will turn out to be an innocent mistake, but if this restaurant thinks it provides an experience worth $200 per head, they need to call Chef Ramsey."
"I dined at Morton's last night Jan 22, 2015.  The food was not good.  I feel I paid $80 for a $20 meal.  Service was great but it sure wasn't Morton's quality??  What the hell is going on people??  With my uncle and myself our bill was $160 dollars and that was with ONLY 2 glasses of wine.  OMG, the cheese cake ( at $12) was very dry.  I'm thinking all the chefs quit after the fire and being closed for so long and Morton's are breaking in the new guys.  YES, this was last night - Bob Segar concert - PLEASE fix it!!!!"
"To all: Morton's contacted me and has sent a $50 gift certificate for our lousy dinner January 22.  Our dinner for two was $160 +tip.  $50 is not working for me.  Just thought I would let them know??  I hope everyone has better success than we did.  Good luck all.J Rock"
"I love a good steak, which I did have my first visit here but this visit was just awful. I took my hubby here for a Father's Day dinner, I feel so bad I definitely have to take him somewhere else.The bread didn't seem fresh it was dry with an intense dry onion rub. Salads were ok, probably my favorite part of the meal actually. The steak I ordered medium due to being pregnant but it was rare, he got his medium as well and was actually done medium. My baked potato side was pretty good, it's hard to mess up microwaving a potato. His side of Mac and cheese was laughable. We were warned numerous times how hot the bowl was it came in but the actual dish was cold, cheese was hard, boxed Mac and cheese would have been so much better. The desserts I can't really say anything about I'm not much of a sweets person.Staff was pretty attentive, you literally take one sip of water and they refill it. I guess I should complain about the service but it ruined the meal having them step in between us 20-30 times. I had to laugh when the one refill splashed my husband in the face mid sentence.Definitely won't be back, too many other good options that don't disappoint."
We had dinner tonight and were so disappointed. We had a party of 15 and the service was so slow we ended up serving the cake ourselves. The food was bland at best. They do not have a children's menu. The only thing that was efficient was the valet service. We won't be back.
"I am the dork-ie kid from your kindergarten  class. Who has been wearing glasses since I was 5 years old so please take this review seriously.  I know my way around a pair of eyeglasses.  Wow am  I getting old , that would mean I have been wearing eye glasses for 20 years.  Do me , you and everyone you care about a favor and avoid this location.  The service is here so incredibly inconsistent.  I have nothing,  I mean nothing good do say about the service that I have received here .The eye glass assistants are rude.  The way you are treated is sub par.  America's Best (I even hesitate to use that name because it's obviously not the best in America) just sucks.   Due to my terrible eye site I have to spend EXTRA money for thin lens.  So normally what I do is,  once a year I shell out $200.00  no insurance to buy two pair of glasses, paying cash.  The frames are alright but nothing that great. Besides my lens not being great another thing I  have a problem with is the poor customer service. On more then one occasion through out the years I have been talked down to.  I have been wearing my current prescription from AB for about 10 months. This prescription is not good for me, before I had a magnified prescription that made everything BIGGER. My poor little blind self I have an astingamstism in both eyes. Two years ago I got good lens with nice frames but in 2012  I got shit lens with an okay frame.  I don't plan on returning to America's Best , it's just not worth it."
"If you look at my Yelp reviews I NEVER give 1 star, but this was the worst costumer service experiences I've had in my entire life. The entire staff was rude. They made us feel like it was such an inconvenience. From lady at the reservation desk who frowned, snarled, and barked commands like we were in a prison, to the embittered woman who was supposed to help run our insurance information, this experience made me feel belittled and terrible. Before arriving we checked with our insurance companies that America's Best would honor our insurance, but when we got there the lady said that they do not take our insurance. After BEGGING and PLEADING that they call our insurance company she finally did and while frowning told us that she was wrong and they America's Best actually did take our insurance. We were so disgusted with our experience here. We called the corporate office (something I never do) afterward and told them that when are contacts arrive we will not go back to this location. The people at the corporate office were actually really nice and had them shipped to the North Hills location instead. When we went to pick out our contacts at North Hills the staff was very pleasant, but it was too little too late. The downtown office has ruined America's Best for me forever. Honestly, I have been telling everyone I know never to go to this sub par establishment."
"I got an eye exam and two pairs of expensive eye glasses in Pittsburgh Downtown branch. It was a horrible experience. Firstly they sold me sample pairs without telling me, I paid more than $350 for two pairs, when I received the eye-glasses luckily I understood there is a problem with them, I went back to the store, they insist they are new pairs, I asked to see the samples and such a coincidence they were not there anymore. I asked them to check the inventory, and they agreed that they are samples. I had to choose new two pairs, but most of the models they have were already so low quality and old fashion. I chose one Rayban and one Calvin K. they were over priced than the market. I had to go to store three times, it means three days permission from the office, and I had to deal w parking in downtown, a horrible and rude customer service. I think they took advantage of me, being an international student. I am writing this comment to save other people."
"Pros- Ambiance - Prettiest venue in downtown Pittsburgh- Space - you can fit a ton of people in the space!- Rania's Catering (required vendor and provided great service)Cons- Sound - Due to the vaulted ceilings, we were never able to get good sound on the mics. There was an echo and most people could not understand anyone talking (MC's, Speeches, etc). Super disappointing not to hear your father or father in law's speech. :(- Management - The venue attracts well to do clientele, but the service does not match the price tag with high quality and accommodating management service. They are more like mean museum curators in the planning process. :) Hotels are far superior in management service.- Common Space is NOT Exclusive, Building Residents are Allowed to Join (and sometimes harass) -During dinner, my fiance, I, and the photographer went to the rotunda to take pictures. A resident came downstairs and started doing Tai Chi in the middle of my party. A 70 y/o man brought out a lawnchair and watched her. We held our tongue and ignored them, but the man shouted at us ""of all the places in Pittsburgh why do they have to take pictures on our property, and in our way?"" . I told them we had rented the entire venue and it was actually private property, and they told Me to shut up. Me, the bride!Im not saying it was a situation of racism, but I wonder if they would have been as ugly, if I was a white bride in a white wedding dress. Instead of a foreign bride, in a red sari. My father in law tried to pacify the situation and told everyone to just calm down. Then the old man stepped up to my new father in law in a aggressive way as if to make him flinch. I told them, ""I am the bride, why are you trying to ruin my wedding day?""..response ""shut up B***, and go inside."" They were joined by another older couple that also chimed in with aggressive and angry language about how they lived there and I was on their private property as we cut our session short and walked back inside. I didn't know I had to hire security to protect myself from the Pennsylvanian residents. When they started behaving physically aggressive, my coordinator called the police. The angry senior citizens also told the police that my photographer (who never even spoke) instigated the situation. Afterwards, PA management did not take a side in the situation, and even suggested we were responsible for the situation occurring. -$$$$ Everything must be brought in from the outside. Tables, chairs, kitchen supplies, silverware"
"Our wedding was this past Saturday.  It was rainy, cold, and miserable outside.  We hoped to get just a few pictures in nice, dry places to help commemorate the day.We stopped by the Pennsylvanian to get a few shots.  We were promptly told, in rude and vindictive manner, that we were trespassing and the police would be called if we did not immediately leave.I understand that they would not want us to use their overhang to take a picture, since we did not decide to use this venue for our reception, but if the manner in which we were ordered off the property is any indication of the staff's demeanor, I would recommend staying as far away from this place as possible.Our friends, one of whom was a groomsman in our party, were deliberating choosing this venue for their reception next year.  They had a bad experience with the staff as well when trying to tour the venue. After my experience with our wedding, I can tell you that service is one of, if not the, most important parts of the day.  Choose wisely, and stay very, very, very far away from places with staff like the Pennsylvanian."
"Don't waste your time.1- they dont sell regular paper and hardly have poster paper.2- its really hard to find any thing of use. Most things are archaic and not in a cool vintage way.3- the owner is a bitch. During park(ing) day 2010 she waited 3 hours before coming out and telling the artist "" i find what you are doing is discussing. I dont support your tree hugger shit...."" extraordinarily rude."
"I went here around noon one day in search of an ink pad, which I thought would be a pretty standard item for a stationery store.  (Turns out I was wrong.)  The store was such a cramped, crowded mess that I had to ask for help to find what I was looking for, but was hesitant to do so because I felt so awkward interrupting the four employees sitting at a table in a corner, eating leftover pasta and engrossed in conversation, ignoring me and the several other customers who were browsing.  When I finally got the courage to ask about the ink pad, the workers all looked at each other as if to say ""Who's going to handle this?"" before one of them grudingly got up to search for an ink pad that, as it turned out, ""didn't come in with the shipment"".  As if Pittsburgh was a hot market for ink pads and they go through their entire supply every week."
"I stopped in because they have knitting supplies. I immediately saw a beautiful cat (they have several in this shop). Being a owner of several cats and extreme lover of all animals, I went over to see the cat. The cat let me pet it and followed me around yowling for attention. I picked up the cat to hold and the man that works there was very rude and ripped the cat away from me. I will NEVER NEVER go back to a store that treats animals or animal lovers that way. The shop isn't that great anyway."
"Such a shame because this place has so much potential for being a cool little local business. But the owners/managers are the rudest, most disdainful people who seemed almost gleeful for me to leave without purchasing something. I went in to purchase either some classy paper or a unique card to write a note to a homeowner to whom I was considering placing a purchase offer for their house. It's a stationary store, so I didn't think my request was unusual. The products there were outdated, in many cases even dusty, overpriced (which honestly, I would have paid a local business if the product had been unique and quality), and disorganized. I was asked if I needed help, to which I replied yes and explained my situation, and a very curt man stood in a back corner and pointed to various corners of the store and said, ""Look there and there and there and there,"" AND THEN HE WALKED OUT OF THE STORE.I'll seriously never step foot in Weldin's again, and felt it necessary to post publicly about the experience. Such a shame.BTW, I found a delightful card next door at CVS. It was made of wood. Very unique. Go figure. ;)"
"I have been a customer of this store many, many times in the past.  I go there ONLY because they are the only source of yarn in the downtown area and I'm an avid knitter.  I put up with the rude employees and dirty store because of this.  I was actually a little excited when they moved because I was looking forward to visiting a clean store.  Here is where my mistake happened.  I recommended them to a coworker.  She just called to ask where they had moved too (I was unsure of the address and it's not on their website or here on yelp).  When she asked the woman how ansered the phone if she could tell her where they moved the woman hesitated and said, yes I guess.  I'm sure she thought we was being funny.  Then she simply said they were located in the Gulf Tower.  When my coworker asked where that was the woman LAUGHED at her and said in a very rude tone, on Grant street.  My coworker has only lived in Pittsburgh for a year, as you all know PIttsburgh is not the easist city to learn.  When pressed for further information about the location the woman had the nerve to raise her tone of voice and tell my coworker that the building had only been there for 100 years!Sad, very, very sad.  They are absolutly DESTROYING their reputation!"
"I found a short black curly hair in my basket of fries... and it was definitely not mine.Needless to say, this completely ruined my meal. Thanks to Peppi's, I won't be eating anything that isn't ready-to-eat as is (like fruit) for the next few days.Not only does the shop LOOK grimey, it IS grimey... Completely disgusted."
"I went down to the strip last week and thought a mocha sounded great. Well I can't write a review on that drink because the employee dropped a dime in my drink. I was expecting her to offer to make me a new one since she was the one the dropped it in there, but instead all I got a was blank stare. The coffee shop down the street had great coffe and they don't drop anything in there as well."
Do not go here during the week if you expect them to open on time. I was there today and it was 615am and there was no employees at all. Managed very poorly. The older lady with a short hair cut is the one who doesn't open on time when she is scheduled. Please move this lady to a different time. 6am is too early for her.
"Out of 200 reviews, I've written only 14 1 star reviews.  that's .07%.  That means I never really write 1 star reviews.  La Prima Espresso in the Strip District gets one.  :(They've got a good coffee but I will never be back, bc the older woman who is the barista in the morning was unforgivably rude, without reason.The coffee is good, I would have liked to become a regular, but I dont want to start every morning dealing with her nasty attitude.  Yesterday she rolled her eyes at me when I asked for lots of room for cream.I am a former barista.  I *know* asking for room for cream is not one of the more difficult special requests she gets!  If you hate the public, you shouldn't work with them.This morning takes the cake, and I just won't be back.  Here's what happened:  I walked in, and she was talking to a gentleman who was obviously a regular.  Because she was busy and bc I've barista'd myself, I waited patiently.And waited and waited.  It was a few minutes, but an eternity when you really need coffee!She never even looked at me.  Then all of a sudden she goes, ""Okay lady are you going to stand there or do you want coffee?""  WTF.  I liked her sense of urgency, but seriously?  Rude.I asked for a medium coffee in a large cup, or if that's not possible, a medium coffee with lots of room. Not hearing me, she goes, ""What was that?"" and the older gentleman said, ""She wants a medium sized coffee in a large cup.""  And the woman turns to me and snaps, ""And you couldn't repeat that yourself?""Even the guy she was talking to, her regular, was like, ""Whoa.""  He tried to make some excuse for her, like, ""She's just fired up today!""  Then the woman slams my coffee down on the counter.  Was she having a bad day?  Am I the doppleganger of someone she hates?  I dont know, I don't care.  I believe she may be the owner because surely she should have been fired by now, as there are other posts with complaints about her. ""Do not go here during the week if you expect them to open on time.

Please move this lady to a different time. 6am is too early for her."" I won't ever be back.  If that's just her spunky personality, well, her personality sucks.  Seriously lady, you're not a morning person.  You should ask for later shifts."
"I'd had a nail appointment set for several weeks - a first time customer.  Less than an hour before the appointment I got a call canceling it.  Not from the owner apologizing for the cancellation or trying to correct the situation somehow, but from the nail tech.  She told me the owner insisted that SHE call her clients herself to tell them she had ""personal problems"" that day and couldn't make it.  Wow.  The lack of professionalism astounded me.  On the positive side, I'm glad I had the experience BEFORE what may have been the worst nail experience of my life.  Imagine how the ""personal problems"" may have affected the work.  I called the salon to let them know of my disappointment in being left high and dry.  They simply didn't care.  They lost a customer....not just for nails, but for all the other services they offer.  Not the best way to run a ""service"" business!"
"Worst Brazilian wax I have ever gotten. Extremely Painful and inefficient, still had a red welt 3 days later. She also used the same stick the entire time which is not sanitary. Eyebrow waxing is significantly overpriced at $18. Do not go here for waxing!"
If I can give haft a star I would. Never shop at this Asian grocery since Many more open. Owner and employee alike no manners and nasty. Sorry guys it's the truth.
I strongly not recommend this store at all for their rudeness. The middle aged woman and the other man seem like manager are extremely mean without any manner. I recommend other Asian markets.
"As Lindsay's best friend and maid of honor, I went with her to Jim Ludwig's a few weeks before her wedding to go over the final order for the flowers.  We sat down and Jim pulled out a list of what they had discussed.  I very clearly remember her confirming dahlias and peonies for the centerpieces.  Not only do I know that she wanted these flowers from the moment of her engagement, but I was also at the consultation to witness the discussion.  The centerpieces were definitely not what she had requested - no peonies OR dahilias and they looked like flowers picked from the side of the road on the way to the wedding.  In no way did the flowers manage to ruin her beautiful day, but they were absolutely not what she requested or confirmed.  I don't understand how there was a ""miscommunication"" as I saw the paperwork.  I just know that I won't be using Jim Ludwig's for any of my own special occassions."
"I ordered a sympathy arrangement for my Aunt's funeral. I requested the flowers to be delivered for the Family viewing on Friday at 3pm. I arrived and was disappointed to not see the arrangement I ordered. After two calls to the florist it was determined that another customer had also ordered a arrangement for my Aunt and wanted their order delivered to the church on Saturday for the viewing prior to the funeral. As a result someone at the florist decides to deliver my flowers not as requested for Friday but on Saturday. Imagine my frustration. I will say after speaking to the owner, Jim Ludwig he did offer to still bring the arrangement to the funeral home. ( no need the viewing was over by the time the situation was sorted out.) He offered to discount my order by 30% which was a acceptable gesture but at the end of the day it really wasn't about the money. Overall was a frustrating and disappointing customer experience for me at what was already a difficult time for me and my family."
"Unsatisfied customer! I ordered a get well bouquet , pictured arrangement was $39.99, I wanted a premium arrangement so I ordered the $59.99 bouquet. How disappointing, has a few lillys, 5 roses, rest is carnations a few baby's breath and filler. For $60 plus delivery? Will take my business elsewhere in the future. One star is for same day delivery."
"Walked into Roxanne's which was full of beautiful and inspiring arrangements only to be caught off guard at how rude the owner was. Was going to purchase a few items, but decided to take my money elsewhere."
"I'm sorry, but as cool as Andy is, I just don't like the sushi.  The tuna tasted metallic and mealy, definitely not fresh.  I actually spit it out in my napkin upon first bite.  The portions are large, yes, and the prices are good, but I'd rather pay a little more for sushi that is less suspect."
"First, do not call me sexy and then give me the two most sinewy pieces of toro possible. That pissed me right off. Second, the rolls here are sloppy. Not only did it fall apart very quickly (and was about 4 times too large to eat: a piece of sushi should be able to be comfortably eaten in one bite), but it seems there isn't much thought given to flavors as far as the special rolls go. After my experience with the toro, I don't think I will be giving any sashimi or  *sushi* sushi rolls a try. While the rolls are large, the prices were quite steep, not what i was expecting for someone based in a market that sells seafood."
"Check your candy purchase for FRESHNESS!  I bought 4 boxes of marshmallow cones.  I carried them on a plane to Dallas TX for my adult niece.  When she opened one of the individually wrapped cones, the marshmallow top was as hard as meringue.  I was embarrassed that I gave her old candy that was just purchased days before.  When I returned to pittsburgh I called Fort Pitt.  They said they couldn't do anything unless I returned the candy.  No apology, no concern.  I will not shop there again.  You can find fresh cones and candy at other stores."
"As of July 25, 2014, a sign on the front said that it was closed permanently."
"Ew! Ew! Gross! I know that's not the most mature thing to say, but that's what comes to mind when I think about this place! Sad thing is, I've been here a couple times. Every time I kept thinking it would somehow get better, but no, it doesn't! The Miso soup they serve has this weird after taste, and to be honest, doesn't taste like any Miso soup I've EVER had! So on to the sushi, oh yeah, it's gross too! I think I kept going back because the size of the rolls are humongous. The thing is the fish does NOT taste fresh at all! It's always luke warm and....just.not.good. Oh well, I tried. But I'd suggest you not!"
Absolutely the worst sushi my husband and I have ever had.  It was Gross!!! I don't know why they use so much rice or why the fish wasn't cold.  You couldn't pay me to go back to this place!
"If you're in the mood for fresh, tasty sushi, this is not the place for you. The food that was delivered to us was simply inedible. Point blank. My husband and I ordered a bunch of sushi for dinner with the plan of having tasty leftovers for lunch the next day, so we splurged a little, spent like $60 on various rolls. The presentation was pretty pathetic - wilting nori, leading us to believe these rolls were pre-made; hot pink ginger, meaning it's the MSG-soaked kind; glue-like rice, where you can't see the individual grains - but what really horrible was the smell. When we took the lid off the tray, the stench of rotten fish knocked both if us back. I honestly gagged.It was so awful, we just stared at each other, amazed that we just spent our money on a pile of stinking rot. Determined to not waste everything, I picked up a piece of spider roll to sniff/inspect/try. IT HAD A HUGE HAIR IN IT, all wound around the crab. Totally disgusting. My husband attempted to try the inari - just tofu and rice, right? It tasted like rotten fish, as it had absorbed all the smells from the other fish rolls. We had also ordered a vegetable and tofu soup, and a green salad with ginger dressing. Can't even believe this, but the salad leaves were brown and slimy on the ends! They actually screwed up a green salad. The soup tasted like the inside of an aluminum pot, all metallic and burnt-flavored. Horrible, horrible, horrible. We literally dumped everything down the garbage disposal. Total waste.We tried to call and complain, but by the time our order was delivered, the place was closed. We will be calling again today to get our money back. Maybe they will earn themselves another star if they do the right thing and refund our money."
"Don't bother with the sushi, can't speak to the Korean BBQ.Long story short: I ordered delivery. Never had sushi delivered before, so maybe this is just the way it goes, but it took almost two hours to get to me. There was condensation inside the sushi container from the rolls sitting on top of the other entree I'd ordered (which was hot) and being held against it in a small bag. Assuming that the rolls were made long before I got them, I just threw out the tuna roll, which was warmer than room temp anyway. Vegetable roll was good, but not exceptional. Fried rice was...just not what I expected, not exceptional either. In short, I paid almost $40 for a cucumber roll and two bites of rice. Maybe this is better when you dine in. Still, would not recommend. Pricey and doesn't live up to it at all."
Being Korean and my kids and I visit all the Korean restaurants when we are out of town.  Since my daughter goes to PITT we wanted to treat our daughter to Korean food.  My family including my wife who is non- Korean always order    and if this is how they want to represent Korean food to others they are doing disservice to our heritage.   was the worst I have ever had.  Their  had lettuce as one of mixing choices and their meat was hamburger meat?  Will not go back.
"I am sorry to say that this place still STINKS.  I work in the strip and often get temped by Sushi Kim.  I stopped in for lunch today and I was the only person in the whole place.  That should have tipped me off.  The last time i was there i had a bad meal, but i wanted to give them another shot.  I ordered the spicy chicken off of the lunch menu.  I believe is was L1......Numbered menu items.....Another tip.   My food was terrible.  The miso soup was horrid and old, the sides were awful and everything seemed to be microwaved.  AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!!!"
Tried this place based on reviews in local paper and friends. This place was awful. We asked questions of the server and ordered based on them. Neither was good.y friend said she cannot eat real spicy food and asked them to tone it down. Her meal was so hot she couldn't eat it.  Mine was just disappointing. The only thing I found good was the plain rice. I also thought it was extremely over priced. Will not return.
Man... Really bad from start to finish. Service is slow and horrible. Sushi is not flavorful at all. The rice was some of the worst I have ever had. I honestly would rather eat day old gas station sushi than come here again.
"My grandma has season passes here. Every now and then, there is a decent play here. Most of the time, we leave at intermission. Unless, like today, there was no intermission. ""Buyer and Cellar."" Has got to be the most boring, annoying, NOT funny, waste of time play!!! Couldn't keep my eyes open!They need to actually watch the plays they decide to put on here, instead of putting all their energy into getting plays written by someone famous?? Another waste of time, wait until people my age get old. I can guarantee you we will not be wasting our time in this theater. You are going down just like the PSO."
"want to start by saying that the show was spectacular and so was the venue. However, we arrived at our seats to find an usher, no not a typo, an usher occupying one of our seats in the third row in the middle. The usher asked my girlfriend and I if we would be ok sitting apart as she was not going to move out of her seat. She then proceeded to tell us that it wasn't a full house and we could find plenty of seats together higher up in the theatre and stayed in the seat for the duration of the show. Without helping anyone to their seats of course. It's a terrible shame, it was a spectacular performance but I won't be buying tickets there anytime soon knowing that my seats aren't guaranteed and can be occupied by employees at any given time"
"This place would be great if they answered their phones, returns your calls, or set up an actual appointment for you."
"Pittsburgh has a shortage of riverfront dining, so this place wins points for ambience on a nice warm day. Have a drink and enjoy the deck, but save your dining budget for somewhere else.  The menu is blah and the food is also.I recently had lunch here, and the waitress first forgot my meal entirely, bringing food to everyone else at the table.  When I reminded her, she returned with my clam chowder, spilled it, didn't apologize, and didn't clean it up.  All that would have been forgiven if the soup had been any good."
"Awful service, overpriced food. Don't waste your money! On arrival, waitress seemed lost.  Ordered food for 3 adults, one kid, food came for adults, after a couple of minutes my mom asked when my sons food would be coming, waitress said she would check, came back and said his pizza hadnt been cooked yet. Cancelled the pizza, paid $4 for a little bowl of white lettuce with some cheese thrown on it, fried shrimp was expense, but looked like cookie cutter frozen shrimp. Spoke to manager, who had a horrible attitude and found out that the waitress never put the pizza order in for my son and then lied and told the manager he wasnt at the table when we ordered our food. If you give these people your money, it would be foolish!"
"The only reason anyone goes to this restaurant is to sit on the deck and drink.  I want to like this place so badly I keep coming back and hoping that it'll be awesome and it just never is.  Like dating someone who is very very hot but also very very stupid, it's amazing how much patience one can have if there's a really good atmosphere.One year I took my father here for his birthday.  I don't usually call people names but our waitress was just a complete idiot to the point we felt bad for her and that was the ONLY reason we didn't freak out on her completely.  She forgot my dad's food order.  She brought out mine, but then neglected to notice that my dad was sitting there with nothing.  The manager came out and took our drinks off hte tab, btu that didn't help very much bc we'd only been able to order one round in an hour of waiting bc the waitress had only come to our table twice.  Then when they brought my dad's steak out, the waitress dropped it (I felt bad for her), and apparently that was their last steak.  I just paid the bill and we left and went to Eat n Park.The second time I came back the service was equally as terrible, but also it was late summer and our table was literally attacked by wasps.  Seriously, attacked by wasps.  My friend got stung.Another time I'd made a reservation for my friends 30th bday and they said htey didn't do reservations but could put tables together.  When we showed up, it was like I'd never called.The last time I was there it was ok, but after being attacked by wasps my friend and I opted for the patio and only ordered burgers.The service here SUCKS.  Getting attacked by bees and then having to wait for your server to bring you ice sucks (holding a cold beer bottle against the sting helps).  It just sucks here.But the atmosphere is fantastic!  When your waitress comes ot hte table, just order a whole bunch of bottled beers nad you should be ok."
"Dear Redfin Blues,I can't begin to express my disappointment in your establishment. Such high expectations were set when we were greeted at the host stand and sent of for cocktails on a 20 min wait list (which apparently never existed). After 30 mins and seeing literally 4 parties that noticeably came in after us be seated, I reminded the host who directed us to the bar that we were still waiting. After 20 more minutes and 2 more parties getting sat (one who sat themselves) I approached a blonde woman seating and cleaning tables to let her know that we could be removed from the ""list"". To which she replied ""what list?"" And didn't even bother to apologize... nothing was offered to assist us in our search for sustenance nor was there anything offered for our inconvenience. Fortunately, for us, the disaster at your restaurant lead us to discover a new place, that we have decided to frequent. So, thank you for f**king up."
"Just returned from RFBlues, where I usually enjoy myself quite a lot.The bartender gave my sandwich by mistake to another customer. No bigdeal; pink salmon looks a lot like white chicken, assuming she'scolorblind. I waited.And had a 2nd drink.Another group of 3 people came in after that, ordered their meals, andgot served their entrees.I went up to the bartender and asked when my dinner would be coming.She announced that ""salmon takes longer to cook"" (than what??? a rawsalad? I cook; salmon is one of the fastest things on earth to cook!),and that ""I was about to check on that..."" It had been over an hour bynow.I got my sandwich promptly after complaining.A few minutes later, when I finished my salmon, I got my side ofvegetables (apparently vegetables take even longer than salmon tocook!).All sarcasm aside: one screw up is tolerable. The second - forgettingto even check on my late order until I complained, an hour after Iordered, is not. And yet, I wasn't given the least consideration inthe bill."
"It was my Anniversary tonight, a Tuesday. I was so excited to get All You Can Eat Crab  Legs!!! My favorite food of all time!!! But when we arrived at 8:20pm, the very unfriendly waitress said that their kitchen was closed!!!!! BOOOOOOOOOO!!!! Their website, as well as Yelp, states that they are open until 10pm!!! We would've been long gone by then! Very disappointing. Well, we ended up driving a lot farther than we intended, but had a wonderful dinner at Joe's Crab Shack in Station Square. I got my LEGS!!!! And they had $2 Hurricanes to boot!!! Ended up eating a better meal, with cheaper drinks, and we ended up tipping our waiter 30% because he was awesome!!!! Should've just gone there in the first place! I will know better from now on!!!"
"Not impressed. We arrived at 5:30, ordered an appetizer and beers as we waited for the fifth and final member of our party. Ordered dinner at 6 pm. Some of the members of our party ordered crab legs, which came out of the kitchen in a timely manner. The rest of us waited an additional 45 minutes until a manager came over to explain that a pizza we ordered was taking longer than expected and would be out in ""4 minutes"". 15 minutes later half of our party needed to leave. They went home hungry and very unhappy. Luckily it was a beautiful day outside. Good luck Redfin blues. It's not even summer yet. Yinz got some learning to do."
"It was a really nice day out so my boyfriend and I wanted to go somewhere where we could eat outdoors. He had never been to Redfin Blues, so we decided to go there. It was Memorial Day, so we expected it to be busy, but when we got there they said there was only a 30 min wait. That was definitely not the case though.We sat on some rocks nearby and waited for our buzzer to go off. We waited, and waited, and waited. There were many tables open, which I think was also confusing people that were coming in after us. We waited about 40 minutes and then overheard the hostess telling someone else the buzzers weren't working. So we turned in those. Even though there were a ton of tables open, we weren't allowed to even sit at them to get some drinks or eat chips, etc. We were told that they were pacing the flow of people because the kitchen was backed up, and that was the reason for the empty tables. ??? We were both amazed that we were not even allowed to sit down to get some drinks, it's their money that they lost I guess though.After waiting about 45 - 50 min, we overhear a tablet nearby asking about their food. The waitress tells them the kitchen is really backed up, so their food isn't going to come for about 40 more minutes but she could get them some chips, etc. (They had already been seated and placed their order about 20 min prior) After hearing that, we bailed. I sadly can't even review the food because the wait was so unacceptable, especially since we couldn't even sit down and get water or drinks. When we told the hostess we were just leaving, she didn't seem very apologetic either, all she said was a quick sorry. I really liked to stop at this place and get some lunch when I was riding my bike on the trail, but my boyfriend said he'd never go back."
"This store has great stuff in it and we all complemented the woman working on how great the store was when we were leaving. I was with 3 white people and 1 black person. When we left, the worker pulled the black person aside and demanded to check his pockets. She did and found nothing. In the middle of the Strip District, this store can still be racist?"
Stopped in looking to furnish my new apartment. I was the only customer in the place on a weekday afternoon. I was never greeted by sales staff or acknowledged. There was an older woman and a younger woman working. As I was browsing the jewelry the older woman said loud enough so I could hear for the younger sales associate to watch me so I didn't steal anything. And I'm a white young professional so I can only imagine how other people are treated.
"I hate to write mean reviews, but I really did receive the worst haircut of my life (no hyperbole) from this place, one that really can't be fixed now until I wait for it to grow out.  I walked in with long hair and normal-looking bangs that all needed significant trimming.  The stylist said he would need to take a couple of inches off of the length due to damage.  I said that was fine.  I did not ask for any other style changes.  I somehow walked out with bangs that take up most of the front part of my head, much like a small child's haircut (to serve the purpose of keeping hair out of the child's face).  He also took almost five inches off the length, instead of the ""couple"" promised.  I feel like my haircut looks like a cross between a bowl cut, a female mullet, and the futuristic look of Mia Wallace from Pulp Fiction.  I'm pretty open minded to different haircuts, but this one is truly awful, and it's too short now for me to even pull it back easily to try to make it look better.  I'm going to a place in Shadyside today to see if they can maybe do extensions to remedy the mullet look, or implement some kind of other cut to make it look a little better.  It's a shame, because this place is downtown and so convenient to my workplace, but I certainly will not risk it again.:("
"At 9:50 AM I walked in, and ordered a chicken biscuit. The girl at the register walked around for a second, came back and said ""we're out."" So I asked what time they stop serving breakfast and she said 10:30 AM. She then said that the girl who's cooking would ""have to make it."" So I asked if that was going to happen. She walks over to three people standing around in the kitchen, asks the cook if she'll be making any more, and the cook looks up at me, makes a rude face and says no. The woman cook then proceeded to go back to talking to the other cooks while leaning on the oven. At that point I would've just taken a plain biscuit! It's disgusting that there are people who have jobs and then go to work and stand around and get paid to do nothing. I mean, how do you tell a customer 45 minutes before breakfast ends that you're ""just not going to make any more biscuits."" A complete lack of work ethic, it's disgusting. I looked at the girl and said, so you're just not going to make any then? Laughed, and walked out. My advice? Hire someone who would be grateful to have a job and who would take pride in it. Those people do exist. You don't have to have people in the kitchen who act like that."
"Rotten food and over charging customer.I was expecting at least a reasonable dinning experience at a reputed restaurant, but was greatly disappointed. The restaurant charged me 20% premium over prices on online menu (I ordered takeout), denied there are prices online. The maitre D was reluctant to show the printed menu, which is 10% more expensive than online, led me to think the over charge was deliberate. The crab cake sandwich is well prepared but from ROTTEN crab. Since I didn't have time to walk 10min one way to return the food, it had to be thrown away.   A lunch over charged and wasted."
"As a lifelong Pittsburgher, I've been to Tambellini's enough times over the years -- and I think it's still open simply because of it's location practically next door to the Benedum, and patrons who go there aren't the regular theater-goers.  I was invited to go with friends, who were old enough to remember when it was probably good.The prices are *outrageously* high for the quality of the food and portions.  I had the Chicken Marsala, which was alright, but something I normally eat served out of a chafing dish at a funeral buffet. This was comparable to a catered version and the restaurant itself deserves a funeral... It's outdated and just a factory for getting people in and out and on time to the cultural events they're going to.The waitress was nice enough, seemed a bit embarrassed to respond 'no' when I asked if certain menu items were fresh.  On the other hand, she disappeared quite a bit and didn't ask if we wanted any desserts -- which we probably would've if we'd been asked.Even though Downtown after business hours isn't the most exciting place to eat, there are other places I'll insist on going instead of back to Tambellini's."
"AVOID EXCEPT FOR SHEER LAUGHSThis place is just textbook in terms of epitomizing what NOT to do in a ""fancy"" Italian restaurant.  Meals are $30 a plate, but ask your waiter for a bottle of Prosecco and he says, ""What is that?""  We ordered a gin and tonic, watched him make it, and were served our mixed drink literally with no ice.  Who serves a drink without ice?  We had no silverware, had to request it repeatedly.  Our entrees, dessert and coffee all came out at different times.  We received the check before being asked if we even wanted dessert or coffee, for that matter.So - service aside, the food is just mediocre and of no relevance to the Italian inspiration it proclaims.  Our stuffed banana pepper appetizer was too hard to cut with a fork but we had no knives.  The prime rib was fatty and cold.  The crab cakes were far more cake than crab, you had to eat around it leaving a pile of filler mush.  Pasta was just pasta.  The atmosphere is also drab and just depressing.  And the split plate fee is exorbitant, so we lied and shared food anyway.  Note that our check was still nearly $300 - for only five of us!Really, truly, avoid this place at all costs unless you're looking for a good story to laugh about.  The only redeeming quality here after an overpriced meal was that it left our party of 5 with a good story to tell.This is the second time I've been here, the first time we just had sandwiches in the basement and it was also far from memorable.AVOID!"
"It's just not that good. We initially told the waitress that we only going to order appetizers and desert. My code for ""we read on Yelp this place sucks, but we wanted to give it a try"" to which she replied they don't alow that but I will let it slide. The food could have come from a buffet and been better. I hate to be super negative, but in this case I am just being real."
"This place is just a flat out joke.  Totally overpriced.  Went before a show and they gave a limited menu and tacked on the token 20% ""service"" fee which gave them the right to provide lousy service.  First I asked for the beer they had on the chalkboard outside.  Had NO clue what I was talking about.  Finally gave up and got a Coors Lite.  Food was overpriced and less than average.  I had the Baked Scrod.  Exact same dish at Eat N Park is $8.99 and better than this $27 dish.  I would stay clear of this at all costs.  If you are going for a night of theater - opt for eating outside the city or at Sonoma Grill down the street.  I'm shocked this place is still in business."
"The only good thing about this eatery is its proximity to the Benedum. The three of us were seated at a table that was jammed in between two other tables, next to the kitchen - even though the place was half empty. I could hear the conversation at the next door table better than that of people sitting opposite me. The food was a sorry, sloppy, soggy mess that would have had Chef Ramsey throw up. The service was slow, inattentive, and made you feel vaguely unwelcome. Ridiculously overpriced. For  better value, a nicer atmosphere, and quality food, I strongly recommend a couple of places nearby that beat Tambellini's hands down - McDonalds or SubWay."
Since closed.  Surprise surprise.
"The view at Sognatore is beatiful from the 10th (or so) story of the Pennsylvanian. I went for my trial run for my wedding do a month before the big day armed with a picture of how I wanted my hair based on a test run done by my salon in the city where I live (not Pittsburgh). The guy did not listen to me at all and created some over-the-top Pittsburgh do with tons of hairspray. I got him to agree that on the wedding day, he would use way less spray and make the bun looser and lower to be more natural. I paid my $85 + ~$35 for ""test makeup"" and then I booked hair and make-up for 5 other people on the day of the wedding. Thankfully, I also had mom take a picture of the hairdo. On the day of the wedding, I sat down in the chair and about 45 mins later was shown a strange version of a plastered Jackie-O french twist or something....it was nothing like the test run style and nothing like what I had requested. I was shooed away to get my make up done and while that was happening, I was told that if I wanted my hair fixed the way I wanted it, I would have to pay another $85 for another appointment! I was spending about $1,000 that day at the salon and I was the bride, and I had already spent $85 for a trial run that was apparently worthless. It was one of the worst customer service experiences I've ever had and it was happening right before I was getting married. The guy eventually tried to fix it but my hair was already plastered with too much hairspray and he was acting like I was being completely irrational just because I didn't like his artistic vision. I showed him the pictures of what he did before and what my other salon had done and crabbily pulled my hair back in a hair band and stuck some pins in it. I will add that the makeup girl was great, very nice and did a great job. But the stylists/management did make any effort to be nice to me and it was way too much money for what I got. I'd try somewhere else if I ever needed a do in the 'burgh."
"ZERO Stars.  Today, my friend in a wheelchair came in and his friends wanted to sit at the bar for a slice.  They asked if there was an exception to the rule about being at the bar.  The manager told my friend that he could not be accommodated.  That's illegal and immoral and absolutely disgusting."
"Done with this place...  It seems every time we go there they get slower and slower.  Today we waited 50 minutes for a cheese pizza that we never got before walking out.  I complain to the guy making pizzas and he says ""you're not the only one's here"".... Well, he secured the fact that I will never be back again."
"Rumor has it that the pizza is good here, but when I saw the prices I decided against it. Instead, I thought I'd get the calzone:  cheese, toppings tucked inside a delicious bread pocket. Well, making it vegetarian friendly was financially impossible. I went out on a limb and asked if they could omit the ham and replace it with some veggies. No. They said that each vegetable would be $2.50 EACH. Yikes. With that said, I opted out of the calzone. I went with the menu described ""fresh sliced"" zucchini. Truth be told, it was obviously frozen, prepackaged, distribution center zucchini. I wish I would have gone with the pizza, but based on the service and quality of food I ordered i won't be back."
The salon is so dirty we left before I let them cut me hair. The sanitizers were old and half full. The scissors and combs were a mess.  http://www.wellbuzz.com/dr-oz-beauty/dr-oz-pedicure-bacterial-infections-dry-pedicure-haircut-ringworm/
"Horrible service and the food is not comparable to any other Ruth Chris I have been to and I've been to them in 10-15 different cities. My rib-eye was all fat and the waitress was so snotty we wanted to throw our drinks at her. Save your money, this place doesn't deserve to be named Ruth Chris. I've had better steaks at the Outback Steakhouse!!"
"Short story: the guy smeared the sole rubber all over the shaft of my boots, said he didn't do it, tried to clean it up and took out some of the leather's dye instead, and didn't give me a refund (I'd already paid).  Moral the story: if you risk this dude, only pay him at the end after you check for damages.  Long story below.Oh, Groupon, you've steered me wrong yet again.  I have awful luck with service at places were I've used Groupons overall...hey, you put out a Groupon to bring in customers, not to be pissed when said customers show up for their discounts! basically, I think the cobbler screwed me because he was only making $5 for $40 worth of services.I dropped off two pairs of leather riding boots to get new heels.  I had called and been given a quote of $20 a pair and was told that they still do same day service.  I'd had a bad feeling about the place after I called for the quote and the guy I talked to the didn't know what riding boots looked like...He thought they had a spiked heel...but I had that magical Groupon to use, so I went anyway.So, I went.  After some haggling (and after seeing I had a Groupon), the cobbler told me that my soles were ""bald tires"" and he had to replace those as well.  So now we're up to $40 a pair.  I said fine because I love these boots and they were quite expensive.  I was told to come back after 2pm.Three hours later, I return.  The cobbler finishes one boot immediately and hands it to me to look at.  I'm pleased and say so.  I pay.  I'd brought my own canvas tote so I start packing up the boots as they are done one by one.  And then I see it appearing on the remaining three boots...the brownish-black rubber from the soles is fingerprinted all over boot's shaft.  Oh, hell no.  Here's the play-by-play:Me: Uhhhh, I don't think this was on the boots before.  [points to blobs]Front Counter Lady: I don't know, but you don't understand the process.  It's not possible for that to happen.Cobbler: [Not even looking]  Nope, I didn't do that.  That must have been there.  Looks like hair stuff.Me: [WHAT] Um, I'm pretty positive it wasn't there.  [Get out my phone for the photo I took of the boots before dropping them off.]C: Nope, wasn't me, but let me see if I can get it off.FCL: [begins rant about how people are never pleased, etc.]Me: If you look at the shaft where it hits the sole, you can see that there are smears and splatters right there.  So, it was not like this.C: What do you expect for same day service?Me: [now fuming]  For you not to damage my boots that I'm paying you to repair.FLC and C: [Talking over each other. Alternatively making excuses about no one else offers same day and blaming me somehow for the shoddy work.][C grabs another boot to clean off and I see that whatever he's using is making it worse by taking off the dye.]Me: Just please give me that back.  I already paid and I don't want you to clean them anymore.C: You really should buy a de-salting and waterproofing treatment if you're going to wear them in the snow.Me: I don't wear them in the snow.  Please just give me the boot so I can leave.C: Okay, baby.  Have a nice day, baby.Don't advertise ""While-U-Wait"" if you're going to gripe and do a terrible job.What would have made me happy, you ask?  If the cobbler had admitted maybe he had made a mistake, voided the $40 dollar charge (the other $40 was the Groupon), and offered to clean them properly for free.  I would have even agreed to run the $40 charge again AFTER he'd restored the boot shafts.  But, instead, he was a total jerk.Additionally, the woman ""working"" the counter had no clue about prices and had random friends using up all of the chairs for customers both times I was there.  And both times, she ignored me for a good two minutes before screeching, ""You need something?""  Rude.FYI, previously both my mom and I had repairs at Ullrich's back when the older Calabrese gent was working and they were at the old location.  The repairs were about 75% cheaper and the service was excellent.  Honestly, I think my family started going here because of the Italian owner (I'm a quarter Calabrese myself), but I won't ever go back.Results: After applying a leather cleaning solution and using a leather shoe brush/eraser, some of the marks are up but the rest appear to be permanent.  This is after 4 hours of scrubbing.  Ugh.  Pictures are posted of the damage for your viewing pleasure."
"I'd like to echo the advice of another commenter: do not pre-pay.I dropped off a pair of boots for salt removal, new heels, and a polish. I was very specific about the polish, because I wanted them to look nice. When I picked up my boots, I noticed that they looked very dull and there was still clumps of wax on them. When I pointed this out to the clerk, she took them back to the gentleman in the back (the owner, I think). He said that the wax hadn't been buffed off. He gave them a quick polish and took $5.00 off the price. If he had then returned the boots to me freshly polished and shiny, that would have been the end of it. The problem was he gave them a  half-assed shine. After sitting for 3+ days with dried wax on them, a quick polish didn't remove much the dullness.  When I pointed this out to the gentleman, he said he had done the best he could. Quite frankly,  If that's the best he can do, he shouldn't be in shoe repair. I finally just gave up trying to make him understand why I was unhappy, because it was clear he wasn't going to help me, and he was becoming rude and unprofessional. I had made the mistake of prepaying. He had my money and had no more use for me. I think if I had owed him money, he would have taken my concerns more seriously, instead of becoming increasingly snarky and mean. I wish that I had paid closer attention to the other negative review about Ullirch's on Yelp (which also includes pictures) because it closely mirrors my own experience, both in terms of workmanship and customer service. The gentleman who owns the shop is sugar and spice when he's taking your money if you foolishly prepay, but quite unpleasant if you dare to complain about shoddy work. Personally, I don't mind if people make a mistake as long as they own up to it and correct it. It's when you're abusive about your own error that I take offense.If you do chose Ullirch's, do NOT prepay."
"This place is horrible. The cobblers do not know what they're doing. You can get better service elsewhere for cheaper.I came to this place to get my dress shoes tapped and have rubber protection pads applied on the front half. There are logos on the bottom of the shoes and I told the cobbler to not cover the logos. The cobbler kept saying that he knew exactly what he was doing. In the end, I found out that he ground down half of the logo on one of the shoes and covered it with the rubber protection. Also, he smeared the black glue (used to apply the rubber protection pads) all over the bottom of my shoes."
"Food was okay, but was very surprised that they have absolutely no handicapped accessibility. Steps to get in from the street, restrooms up the stairs to 2nd floor. No accessible stalls in restrooms. Surprising in this day.  NOT HANDICAPPED ACCESSIBLE."
"Based on the AWFUL service I received the last three times I dined here I will never, ever come back to this restaurant--and it is a real shame bc I really wanted to like this place.Strike 1 (and the biggest offense) Light Up Night - I called for reservations but was hung up on and told we didn't need them.  My party of 4 arrived at 5ish expecting a packed restaurant but the place was EMPTY.  We asked for a table and were told due to the amount of reservations it was going to be an hour.  I get that--but the place was EMPTY.  The host was NOT gracious about this, instead he seemed frazzled and bothered by our being there.We sat at the super cool looking bar and ordered drinks and asked if we could order appetizers to the bar.  The bartender, who was a complete dick, said, ""I have a full house tonight, I'm not going to take food orders at the bar.""  I'd like to mention this guy is apparently the bar tender at the Papa J's in Carnegie--not the regular bartender who is awesome.The place is EMPTY.  We order drinks.  And we wait, and we wait, and we wait.  All the while we can see empty tables and I kept thinking...you know...if you had just sat us we would have been out of here by now!  So I asked the bartender who was helping the host...  ""Why can't you just seat us since the place is empty, its been an HOUR and we just want to know when you think we might get seated.""  We would have left but honestly we were invested with our time at this point.  The bartender said, ""Well, for all the people who could take the time to make a reservation, we hold a table for them.""  Well...yikes.  If this is how you act no wonder your restaurant has been dead every single other time we have been there.When we finally were sat, we were seated in a tiny table wedged in a room with a huge party that was three sets of parents and like, their 36 screaming children.  It was such a nightmare.Turns out they had the regular bartender waiting tables that night and he felt so bad about our wait and where we got seated he took one of the entrees off the bill.  So that was cool, but not enough to make up for his moron coworker.Strike 2 - If you go there for lunch and you order a hamburger, expect the waitress to give you attitude if you ask for cheese.  ""Yeah, if you didn't know this was an italian restaurant and we only have mozzerella.""  Really?  I didn't know hamburgers were traditional Italian fare.  I wouldn't have been that upset but my hamburger--which was burnt, flavorless, and tasted like freezer burn along with my diet coke came to $14.00.  For a burger.  and a coke.  The prices here can be ridiculous.Strike 3-  Empty restaurant.  I mean, EMPTY.  My friend and i are there and we had bread wiith our meals.  Our thing of olive oil was empty, and there was a full thing of olive oil on the table next to ours.  NO ONE ELSE in the same dining room.  I took the olive oil off the table next to ours.  Our waitress came over and was like, ""Ma'am, this is not a free for all, you can't just take things from the tables if you need something you have to ask.""  WTF!  There was no one there and it was just olive oil... and also had she been attentive, I wouldn't have needed to take the olive oil.  She would have brought us a full one.So, I've tried this place 5 times and that was enough.  I dont know how it remains open but I suspect it will close soon.  Not worth the attitude of the staff.  They dont seem to appreciate the few customers they do have which is a shame, bc when I like a restaurant I recommend it and I bring my friends there."
"I will never complain about philly gay bars and clubs again. after visiting pgh for a bit . i went searching for my ppl , that in itself was a chore, when i finally found a bar it was not the most pleasant, it's this bar /hole in the wall called IMAGES.  At first i thought it would be a good experience but after my first drink i was over it. The dring was so watered down that drinking water would hv had more of a kick. I finished it   though, although it was only 3$ it could hv been better,  the bar tender was not the friendliest either. After my first drink, i waited and waited and waited for him to notice me and inquiry of me if i wanted another, which i did but after being ignored i decided to go  somewhere else, if he didn't want my money I'm sure there are others that would be willing to take it. So i left. They say first impressions are the strongest and last lasting ones, well my impression of this place was not good. being from out of town i expected a bit more  but i Guss that's asking for too much. In all fairness  I'd give this place another chance to earn my business or never to come back. On to the nx."
"The gelato counter was disappointing.  The woman who served us told us that it was ""rated in the top 5"" gelatos in the country and added that it was ""from Philadelphia.""  Isn't that the same as ""not made fresh in Pittsburgh?""  When we asked if we could mix flavors, she said that we couldn't do that because ""it's too messy.""  What she should have said was that the portion would be too small to able to mix.  She oh so carefully dipped less than a full scoop and dropped it in the cup.  The gelato wasn't good enough to be short scooped, even in a fancy chocolate shop in the Strip district.  Maybe they figure that the tourists who stop there won't be coming back anyway.  If you find yourself at Mon Aimee Chocolat and want gelato, leave immediately and go to Mercurio's on Walnut St. in Shadyside.   There you'll find better gelato, more flavors, which you can mix, and you'll be served with a smile."
I stopped by Mon Aimee because they carry a chocolate hazelnut wafer (hanuta) that myself and a few friends enjoy. I decided to take a quick snap chat video of their other varieties to show some out of towners what they were missing out on. As soon as I opened the app a woman (very rudely) stopped me and insisted I put my phone away or leave. I understand they don't want any one to copy their style. However that is not what Pittsburgh is about. There is no room for 'snobs' like that in our city. This is just my experience. I have heard others say they were not very friendly which is very unfortunate because Pittsburgh is so welcoming. Grandpa Joe's and Sinful Sweets are great alternatives.
"Very rude staff, they follow you around like the secret service watching every move you make. Please you are not there to help me carry a candy bar to the register.And on top of all of it, you have a $10.00 minimum on credit and debit cards, AT A CANDY STORE?!No thanks, much better candy shops around the city."
"Rude!  Especially if you have a kid with you they don't even want you in their store! I went here a few months ago to get my little one a treat. I must say their attitudes suck big time! Thats putting it nicely there's other ways I could describe them but it wouldn't be appropriate posting it on the Internet. They follow you around and every item you look at they jump at you like you're going to run off with out paying. NEWS FLASH IF I DIDN'T HAVE MONEY I WOULDN'T BE IN THE STORE! Any way I couldn't figure out what their problem was it could be the possibility they don't like kids, don't trust people who aren't snobs like them, or people that are like me with tattoos and piercings. It very well could be all three..As the other reviews said there are way better candy stores in the area that welcome your business and will treat you with better customer service. If zero stars was an option for reviews I'd give this place no stars.  Thank you for your horrible customer service I will never be back.."
"There's nothing about this specific location that is bad.  It's the Einstein Bagels food itself.  I got a Santa Fe Egg wrap, and I don't understand how they can use the term ""egg"" in the name.  There's no way in hell that slimy yellow gelatin came from a chicken!   Absolutely horrible."
"""Could have bought it in a store"" Hershey ice cream that had the crystal-y signs of freezer burn.  Totally disinterested staff included a girl that was texting when we walked in and shouting into her cell phone when we walked out.  No one gave us a bill and I had to interrupt the person at the cash register to get her to take my money.  Didn't even get a ""thanks"" with my change.So not worth the walk that we took to get here."
"This place is terrible!!!! I went for the first time on National Ice Cream Day 2015 and thought, why not give them a try. Ugh. The entire place needs to be gutted and renovated. There's so much dead space, missed opportunity and with the crowds: chaos and disorganization. Skip it!!!"
"I made an appointment 3 weeks in advance when I was texted after I leftA voicemail. It took a couple days to schedule as the woman, Retta, forgot her appointment book one of the days. When I showed up to my surprise it is looks like it would be a closet...right beside the elevator, no window, an office right next door that looks to take up most of the right side of the building. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried to open the door to go in...locked. Okay I think it's just one lady named, Retta. So I waited since my appointment was at 5 and it was 4:45. Around 4:55 I lightly knocked, nothing. I gave her a call and she didn't pick up. At this point I really had to use the restroom. I waited until 5 and knocked normally so that it would be heard. I sent her a text touching base and asking for the bathroom code. Around 5:05 I knocked again. 5:12 I called again and left her a voicemail letting her know I'd been waiting and would wait another 3 minutes before leaving and contacting Amazon local for a refund. I asked a few people if they'd ever been there and go the responses were all no. A few people I'd run into on my way knew where it was as they pointed it out to me. Around 5:15 the same men came back around and one knocked very loudly for me and they found me the bathroom code, thank god! So I come back at 5:20 and knock one last time. I left and have not heard from Retta and it is now 5:40. I'll be reaching out to Amazon Local for sure."
"I'd give it ZERO stars if i could. Worst customer service! My husband made an innocent mistake and confused the weekends for our trip back to his home town. We asked that we get the credit and offered to add a night to our stay. The hotel would be out NO money. But these corporate suits refused. So - they've lost a customer - a PLATINUM customer. We've given Marriott so much bloody money over the years, but these greedy suits could care less. A little goodwill would have cost them nothing. Where has good customer service gone????? Truly pathetic. And believe me - theres nothing special abt this hotel. The William Penn, the Doubletree, and several other hotels are FAR FAR FAR superior. Get good rates on Priceline. Heck - i'll even give a shout out to the Renaissance downtown -- it's not owned by the Courtyard jerks. Good luck! Go Steelers!"
"When I checked in, the front desk staff was missing.  When I checked out, the front desk staff was missing.  The valets had to be chased down every single time I needed to park or retrieve the car.  When I called a week later regarding the charges on my account, the first call was disconnected.  On the second call, I was put on hold for ten minutes before I gave up.  On the THIRD call, I asked the clerk to email me a copy of a form, and she informed me that the scanner was down and she would be unable to for several days.The pillows were appalling and there was no complimentary breakfast and no refrigerator.Does ANYBODY run the show here??  What a disgrace to the Marriott name."
"Literally worst service i've ever received at a hotel. Was using a conference room for multiple days and had to beg snooty staff to come refill waters and clean the room. Also, policies like how much parking costs seem to change from visit to visit. To sum up, i cringe thinking i'll ever have to speak to the people at the front desk again. The location is amazing, they have that going for them. Do not stay here. You will be disappointed."
"This hotel is well located. However the staff, especially Zac don't care a bit if you have elite status or not. The staff is young. The manager nowhere to be seen. No upgrades. Room has high ceiling. So what. Not personal at all strictly business. Restaurant no great shakes. One of three. The better restaurant is the little cafe across the street owned by same owner. Bellhop seen limited times. To get a cab walk to the Westin across the street. Or take a bus. No hello on entering. Not friendly. So why stay here? Not a 4 star. Really a 3 star. Point redemption way too high. Nothing to recommend. Stay at the Westin across the street and kiss the staff there goodbye. Run. Don't walk away.  Not even the shuttle goes anywhere useful. Linda b august 2013 will never stay again!"
Do no stay here if you plan to sleep before 2:30 AM. They could not care less that there is a very loud bar directly across the street. If loudness doesn't bother you than this place is fine.
"My wife wanted deli so we went here.  Boy, was that a mistake. Her corned beef was brown and bad. My lean pastrami was  okay, a bit better than edible.  My dad liked his salad.  The kids liked their turkey and hot dog.  So far, two and a half stars. The real reason for the single star was the cole slaw.  It was off.  As in, spoiled.  I had my salad eating father confirm the fact (he had to spit it out).  When I brought it to the counter and told them, the guy was nice enough to offer me another side. He then tossed the slaw without so much as a sniff. I fear for subsequent patrons."
"Yuck I have avoided this Subway like the plague. It's too bad that this location is the most conveniently on the way to my job.  I literally walk past this Subway 5 times a week.  Even at 1:15pm it's never packed there for lunch and the reason why is  because their sandwiches stink. When I say gross I mean that the standards for food are as low as the standards for cleaning. The attitude of the workers here is just pitiful. The don't care about making a good sandwich nor do they care about keeping the place clean. What a wreck. As some one who eats at Subway 3 times a week I feel entitled to my opinion, avoid this subway."
"Incredibly slow, worst club I've ever had...hilite was the tortilla soup. That was actually edible. Waiting 40 minutes for a cold club and cup of soup is totally unacceptable. Especially when we were the 2nd table seated of the day."
"I treated my younger sister and kid brother out to dinner , to recognize their high PSSA scores and over all academic success so far this school year.  What can I say the kids just love this place.For me the food was terrible.  I wouldn't even have cooked this way for an enemy. I got the cabo shrimp salad. This was four tiny dried up shrimp served in a bowl with ice berg lettuce an rotten tomatoes.  The kiddies had Beatlejuices which is grape juice and Sprit with a gummy worms. They also had Oreo milk shakes which they demolished and said were super yummy. Each of them for dinner also had a cheese burger. The burger was juicy and delicious. I have to comment on th bathrooms. They are in terrible shape. The toilet paper rolls are broken so instead of fixing the toilet paper rolls Max and Erma's just sit the roll of toilet paper on top of the broken toilet roll. I couldn't believe it!"
"I had previously reviewed the Golden Palace buffet, stating that it was some of the worst Chinese food I've had.  Well, this place manages to be worse than it.The place is rather run down.  The buffet was really terrible.  Food left to sit out in just its oil and a barely lit heat source.  It just wasn't a great environment.  Try something else, definitely!"
"I can't tell you how bad this place is, regretted not looking up on yelp for reviews before ordering for delivery.Seriously this place has the worst Chinese food I've had in my whole life!!!!!!!!!!"
Bad!!! Worst Chinese food in Pittsburgh!
"This is the worst Chinese food I've had. Ever. And Pittsburgh has some pretty bad Chinese places.  The Golden Palace buffet is bad, but at least edible.  I am utterly baffled at how this place stays in business."
Dined in. Food had obviously been sitting out all day at the buffet. Lo Mien was soggy and had unidentified black grit in it.  Broccoli was clearly unwashed whenever it was cooked. Finally I ordered beef with broccoli and the meat looked pale like chicken but tasted to gamey to be chicken or beef. First time I ever wondered if I was being served cat.
Stopped in for a quick drink on new years eve about 3 pm . The place was empty . The bartender Chris was rude and very vulger . He made a crude sexual comment as soon as we sat down . We decided to stay for a drink anyway . After going a couple of choices we were told the bar was out of most stock . On New Years Eve ??? The Bartender kept complaining about his job and bosses for the next 10 minutes . We paid for our drinks and got up and left . Might be the strangest employee experience I had in awhile .
"Every time I come here, hoping, just hoping that I'm going to have a couple delicious hotdogs. Raw. Unfiltered. Old school. Like a ballpark from the 1920's or something.But each time I come away disappointed, even more than last time.My father worked here three or four decades ago. I'd love to love this place and recommend it to my friends.The service is anywhere from good to great, and they are fast and friendly!And maybe, just maybe, I come when the hotdogs have been sitting on the grill too long. At odd hours. or an hour after the rush.Every time, the hotdogs (and brats) are harder than a rock.  Not a snappy casing, no, this is like barely edible hard exterior.So what's a man to do? Try again?  Sadly, I'll probably forget about my recent experiences, and try them again.I just hope they are fresher next time, because I can't imagine them worse than today."
I walked into Sammy's expecting a ny style corned beef sandwich and that is not what you get. I don't think Sammy has ever even had a good corned beef sandwich. Meat was dry under seasoned and Luke warm. The bread was just sliced supermarket bread. I hate to say it but giant eagle makes a better sandwich than this place. Don't waste your time
Rules made by men. Check them before you book this church to get married or any other event. Their restrictions are far beyond respect and more on the ridiculous side. Stay away from this church.
"It took over two hours for our lunch here and it wasn't even busy.  When the food finally came it was bad.  We never received an apology.  The prices are cheap, but it's not worth it."
The food was terrible! I got the crab cakes and they were mostly bread crumbs. Two people at our table got the crab bisque and neither could take more than 2 spoonfuls. It was a Wednesday at 7:30 and the restaurant was completely empty besides our group. We quickly found out why. I would NOT recommend this place for food.
Mahoney's is the type of place where women are accosted by the bartender as my girlfriend was this evening. Don't go!
"After a work happy hour a few doors away, several of us were looking for a place to eat, and were having a hard time deciding. I was the pain in the tukkhas, since I'd driven my antique car, and kind of needed to be able to park it where I could see it, plus, I'd really planned the evening to be a birthday dinner for one of the co-workers. We decided to split up, and me and the birthday girl go somewhere, and the rest would hit something within walking distance. Then as Birthday girl and I got to my car, we realized we were parked in front of a restaurant, and Mahoney's won out by default.We should have gotten in the car and driven somewhere else.The atmosphere was pleasant enough, but the food...yeesh.Everyone placed their orders, mostly sandwiches of one variety of another, sided with fries, plain or sweet potato, or slaw. I ordered the Reuben hoping for the best, but definitely not receiving it.Michael's chicken breast with plain fries arrived with sweet potato fries, and instead of just bringing him a side of regular fries, they took the whole plate back to make the switch. Kim's turkey Rachel arrived, and as it was handed in her direction, half of the stuffing fell off the plate and onto the floor. The server took the plate back to the kitchen so that Rachel could be re-stuffed, and for the rest of the evening her initial guts laid right there on the floor. Kim #2 had a fried fish sandwich, which looked a little withered, and then there was my Reuben. More like an Ewwwwww-ben.The bread was dry as chalk, and the corned beef had been so overdone, it looked like bacon sticking out of the bread. Dry, dry, dry...and I took maybe two bites of the slaw, and that was quite enough.The prices aren't steep, but seriously people, take some pride in what you're handing off to a customer. Would YOU eat that?? Seriously, put that order down on the counter in front of you...and take one minute to LOOK at it...then make one exactly like it for yourself. Are you gonna eat that? If not, um, why would we want to pay for it?The service was pleasant enough, and the atmosphere was comfortable enough for nice conversation. But would I go back? Nope. The food, my reason for going to a restaurant, was dreck.My apologies to my co-workers for forcing them to try it along with me."
Terrible. The food they brought us didn't match what was on the menu. They brought out a different wine then we ordered and didn't tell us until we ask. They messed up out bill. They didn't accommodate for a member of our group that had an allergy. The beer was skanked. The soda was flat. Possible the worst restaurant I was ever in.
"Worst experience at a restaurant ever.  I don't need anything fancy but this was pathetic.  My coke was colored water, when I sent it back she said they just changed it.  Came back and said we don't have coke, would you like a sprite.  The sprite was flat but I was afraid to order a water after that.  Why didn't we just leave then.  The menu had quite a few spelling errors we joked about but no joke - don't go here.  If I could rate this a zero, I would."
Worst restaurant ever. Only place with openings on a Saturday night. Waited for 25 minutes to be seated when there were multiple tables open with workers walking past us not acknowledging our presence. Finally got seated and waited 20 minutes for waters and then ate mediocre food. Won't be back.
"bad bad badI was in town for colts steelers in October 2014. i got the steak and fresh cut fries. the steak was rough and bad. i love most French fires. he fries were a joke. they were thin and small. for me to say i love French fries and be disappointed with them says that they were un filling. i will never be back. i live in small town ohio. i have better food in m own. i disliked the meal so bad i could make better food at home then therethe bathrooms are a health department violation"
"This is a review for the AMTRAK CAPITOL LIMITED train route between Pittsburgh and Chicago.Riders beware. This is  a nightmare and a completely unreliable mode of transportation. Norfolk Southern owns these tracks. Unbeknownst to the lay traveler there has been delays BOTH ways on this route for the past 2 to 3 months.  Freight cars get preference. 7 mile stretch in Indiana with only one track.  Delay was 6 hours going to Chicago and over 7 hours coming back. The staff are trying to do their job but seems like the situation is out of their control. Amtrak fails to let customers know realistic arrival time. Terrible experience, I give it a F."
"This place was horrible. Did not, even for a moment, have a seat on the chairs while i waited to board the next train. The walls were dirty, nasty and dingy. It smelled awful inside. It was quite crowded. And I just did not like my surroundings.And dont let me get started on the restroom. after seeing the filth in here, i decided to walk down the street at 5am in the freezing cold to the greyhound station nearby to use their facilities.There was absolutely no type of cafe or even little convenient store within this station to grab a bite to eat while you wait. I did find a vending machine to get coffee but even that was watered down. This place needs to be torn down and rebuilt from the bottom up. I waited with my family down the street at a different station before we had to be back to board our train. I will be sure to not have this place in any of my future stops. Not a good way to sell the city...Horrible!The only reason why i give this station 1 star is because the train itself was quite comfortable and clean."
Small simple train station. No Red Caps to help customers is a big downer.  Traffic getting out is horrendous also.
Train was delayed by 4 hours but did not update until 30 minutes before arrival. This continued for the total of 4 hours. There is no Wifi and only two outlets. I decided to take the train because of the speed and comfort of walking around during my journey. The cons outweighed the pros. It would have probably been better to take the Mega Bus. The Washington DC train is on a performance standard which means it is constantly being checked for efficiency in time. Right now it is at 30% :(. Not good at all.
"Unbelievably bad! If the roach crawling up the wall doesn't scare you away the terrible fried rice will. The egg rolls have only cabbage in them. The ""chicken"" is dark, fatty, and inedible. Don't miss the 100 pound tub of MSG as you walk in. I paid for my food ate half my egg roll noticed the roach, food was then delivered, I took one look at it and threw it out, and left. You should skip this place for sure."
Did not enjoy my meal what so ever.The staff was cold and the seating area was dirty. The place was more of a hole in the wall then I can appreciate. Cheap but your getting what you pay for in quality.
"If a place downtown isn't busy at lunch time then either you're much more wise than the hundreds of thousands of professionals OR the place stinks.  Fu Lai is the later.  The food was gross and I usually wouldn't say that about a place.  My General Tso's seemed to have been previously frozen and I think I got 100% gristle.  I don't shriek at the sight of MSG, but this place uses a bit much.  I got a whopping 2 pieces of wilted broccoli and 1 sliver of onion in my dish and the sauce ewww the sauce.  Not sure why I stepped into Fu Lai, probably because I wanted some cheap Chinese.  Never going back."
"I tried to give this place a chance despite it's reviews. It's not worth it. They were very quick (food ordered and delivered in under 25 minutes). The only thing is, my lo mein noodles were way overcooked and didn't have one vegetable in them. The noodles were very bland and almost chewy. My boyfriend's general tso's was less than subpar. The egg roll's didn't even have shrimp in them. Next time, I'll listen to the reviews."
"This is by far the worst Chinese food I have ever had. We ordered general gso extra spicy and there was absolutely no taste to it. There wasnt even sauce! It was horrible. The fried rice didn't have any vegetable in it and was so bland. The egg roll wasnt even cooked and the cabbage was awful. I called to complain and they hung up on me. I would never recommend this place to anyone. Don't waste your time, order from somewhere else."
"The preparation was fast and the price was very reasonable but it doesn't make up for the fact that everything had a bad, weird taste and the food inevitably made us very sick afterwards. We ordered for pick up and they forgot our drinks and plastic ware. I will definitely never order from here again. Absolutely disgusting."
"The Chinese donuts are amazing...... but that's it. I had General Tao's chicken w fried rice, and the chicken wasn't chicken.... I'll forever order the donuts but that's it!"
"Very displeased. I use to go here years ago and they were friendly and the food was great. I was in the area and ordered beef fried rice. First of all, I thought the place was closed because it was so dark looking inside.  The lady at the counter was overall rude, I don't know what her problem was. She didn't smile, she wasn't polite at all and overall acted as if I was bothering her. While she was making my food, I noticed a guy sitting ON the FLOOR with what looked like a bucket of chicken meat? He was pulling pieces apart putting it back in the bucket and discarding whatever it was in the trash tin can next to him. Overall it looked unsanitary and gross. I had a weird vibe to just ask for my money back and walk out but I figured I'd give them a chance. She comes back with my food and puts it on the table for me to grab. No ""Thank you, have a nice day"" or ANYTHING. I looked in the bag, no fortune cookie, not even a utensil to eat with. I asked for it and she again acted as if I was asking for too much {whatever}. I get back to my location to grub and find little to NO BEEF in my beef fried rice. I literally counted 7 tiny small and THIN pieces {not even full strips}. The beef itself was tasteless and the rice alone was oily and nasty. The fortune cookie itself was stale! I never in my life had a stale fortune cookie before lol. This place use to be awesome! Food use to be great! The people were nice and friendly! I don't know who is running the store now but they will NEVER get a dime from me again. EVER! I never in my LIFE had to empty everything on a plate to see if there was even ANY MEAT in the food! Deuces!"
"They lost my clothes and charged me for stuff I never sent.Clearly they do not know what they are doing and need to get their act together!!"
"DO NOT GO HERE! They staple your name to your clothes because they can't handle organizing your things. Even with that, they've lost my clothes before. And now I just got a $110 sweater back from being dry cleaned and the loop to hold the tassel on is ripping off. They are clearly incompetent. Not only that, the place smells like an ashtray when you walk in. How are your clothes even clean when they come from that? Awful."
"Not only did they damage a sweater, they told me they would take care of it with my tailor and never did.  On top of that, they write in PERMANENT MARKER on your clothes! Unbelievable! Stay away from this place.  Take the time and take your clothes somewhere else."
"I used Galardi's for ~ 4 months when I first moved to Pittsburgh. I've since changed cleaners. I think Galardi offers great service for pick up and deliver dry cleaning in the downtown area. The owner is actually a nice lady; but, after nearly having 3 shirts ruined I decided enough was enough. I think their delivery guy is a huge part of the problem, I actually like the owner, but I can't keep having my clothes messed up and not have anyone take responsibility for it. I wish I could tell people to go here but I can't do it in good conscience."
"The restrooms looked like after an bombardment, an improvised shack amid buckets of olives and spices. Highly questionable hygiene for a food store!Disgusting. I will not go back until they clean up the place. It's just filthy!!!"
"Have been going to the Pennsylvania Macaroni Company for years. Love their fresh pasta and great selection of cheeses. Always great service, however today was the exception. Rudest woman at the cheese counter. Then went to get the fresh pasta and the woman behind the counter was downright nasty. She was covering the pasta at 4:00, they close at 4:30 and I asked her if it was to late to get pasta. She rolled her eyes at me and said uh yeah-we are putting it away right now. A simple yes or no would have been nice. I said ok thanks anyway. Then she must have reconsidered and said well did you want something??? In a very rude voice. Needless to say I walked away. Wow! Pennsylvania Macaroni Company needs to work on customer service. Obviously she hates her job, then get another one! If I didn't drive so far to get there I wouldn't have written this review. Every January I buy 3 months worth of cheese for my family members. I won't be doing that anymore."
"The staff at Gateway made me feel like a customer at a used car lot. They are pushy about selecting expensive, unnecessary options and do not ask the customer which choices they want; they simply write it down and then bill you. I was told there would be a $30 charge for a digital retinal photograph, which I consented to. Other than that, I was not informed about which services were covered and which were not. I was not given clarity or any explanation of services which were added to my bill without asking me. For example, anti-glare and a lens warranty were added by the staff member automatically, so I had to actually stop them and object to individual services, which they then tried to convince me to get anyway. I felt uncomfortable and pressured into services that I was never told the cost of until I was paying the bill at the front desk. The cost was exorbitant, and I was not at all prepared based on my conversations with staff. It cost me over $500 (after my insurance coverage, which is quite good) to get my glasses and contacts updated. I am not planning to return to Gateway for any future visits, and I would never recommend it to others."
"What an embarrassment. Rotten/black  salad greens. A server with a black eye. Pedestrian ""signature"" pasta. Plates and glasses left uncleared. Greasy, scratchy plates at buffet. All yours for $28 per person!"
"What a disappointment. When the water glass cracked in my hand as the server poured and soaked us, we should have known it would be that kind of evening. Worst part of the meal was the pasta trio--the limpest, pastiest, most tasteless mass of lukewarm pasta I have ever been served. One waiter saved the day by insisting I reorder, while everyone else in the joint was content to let us stew. Every aspect of the experience was substandard although when I reordered, the beet salad was very good. Overall, Lidia should be ashamed to have her name on a place like that."
"Lidia, you should be ashamed! This spot wouldn't have lasted a year in NYC. Citizens of Pittsburgh, don't be fooled. Lidia's is average at best. I ate here when it opened,a and again 4 years later. Nothing has changed. We did have some great bar nibbles, quality cocktails, and a good bottle of wine off of a pretty good list, but the food and service lacked. For starters we were served ice cold meatballs and limp soggy salads. The took away everything and only brought back fresh salads (mind you, we were one of about 10 tables being served that evening!). The entrees were dull and lacked seasoning. The servers were confused (how many times does it take to ask fro fresh pepper?) and our waiter seemed to hand off our table to another server. It's tough to find anything good here. Just another 'poser'."
I had really high expectations for this place but the food was overpriced & bland my lasagna tasted like it was made by Stouffers. The service was excellent the food nothing great.
"Ate at this resturant while on a business trip. We chose Lidia's because of it's excellent reputation in the downtown Pittsburgh area. I have to say I was pretty dissapointed by my overall experience at this resturant. Our food was just average, nothing special. I had the gnocchi and the salmon (shared between the two of us.) The service was absolutely horrible. Our food took over an hour and half to come out and we were the only people in the entire resturant. Our waitress Carrie was extremely rude and had a really bad attitude. I would probably not come back."
"Took my friends from out of town to Lidia last night, very disappointed. I couldn't understand why people raving about it too much. OVER Charge and terrible food. None of us could finish the meals cause they tasted so bad even we were very hungry. Our  waitress looked dirty and no teeths...services was ok, not that great. Olive garden is away better than this place. This was my first time and last time."
"Terrible will never go back.From toothless busers to pasta that tastes like a soup kitchen rewarm.Calamari was not fresh.Pasta trio had the worst sauce I have ever tasted.I grew up with fresh tomato meat sauce and worked with chefs from Italy.This would have hit the garbage in less than a second if I handed this to them to serve.Seriously when you are attempting to show class.....Do not hire people that look like they just walked out of the trash bin! Toothless busers asking to remove dishes that I am eating is Unacceptable."
Purchased a groupon so we could check it out-unfortunately very disappointed.  Caesar salad was drowning in tart dressing. Pasta trio - 1 out of the 3 was passable. The bread was good and the wine (included in the groupon deal) was pretty good which  is pretty sad because I'm sure Lidia's had no hand in making either of the 2 things I didn't mind from the dinner.  Good groupon deal but terrible food - will not be back.
"Horrible. Baby Girl bought a groupon, and we revisited after a about a 4 yr hiatus. I don't remember it being this bad. Wettest, limpest Caesar salad I ever had, couldn't finish half of it. Pasta trio was bizarre. Three disjointed pastas that fight each other in flavor are piled on your plate. Penne undercooked. Fettuccine flaccid. Only passable pasta was the pear & ricotta ravioli. Too rich, though. We were there for an hour and fifteen minutes, two courses, and it wasn't that busy. Waitress walked away two times while opening our bottle of wine. Crazy. We got the tiramisu to go, I couldn't deal with this place any more. Lighting is distracting, felt like I was in a food court in the mall. Carpet was all jacked up. Looked like fraternity house carpet. Clientele was strange...lots of sleeveless T's and baseball hats. I didn't even see that the one time I was at the Olive Garden.  Staff was inattentive and bothered. I was really looking forward to going, as we love (tangentially) related restaurants Babbo & Esca. Never again."
"My husband and I opted to go to Lidias for restaurant week since he had never been before. I've been there for brunch in the past and had good meals, so I thought it'd be a nice place to take my Italian hubby. We both selected the prix fix menu with wine pairings. ($35 + $22). It was apparent when we sat down that they were understaffed. The hostess began taking our drink order because our waitress was busy. When the waitress finally got to our table, we told her that we wanted to do the wine pairing and she offered us a few tasting options. They had a decent wine selection, and both her recommendations were delicious.We both started our meals with caesar salads. The salads came out and the plates were a little sloppy in appearance. They were over-dressed and way too big for a starter salad, and the croutons were soggy as if they had been sitting in the dressing for a while. At this point, we hadn't seen our waitress in a long time; maybe 15 minutes had gone by and we were nearly done with our salads before the wines came.For the main course, I selected the gnocchi and grilled sausage. The sausage was made in-house and was very flavorful. The gnocchi, however, was so burnt it was like eating dehydrated, crunchy noodles with a dense chewy inside. Very unappetizing and I was unable to continue eating.My husband had the pasta trio, which is a table-side serving of three different pastas. The first was a spiral noodle in red tomato sauce, which was good. The pasta was cooked al dente and the sauce wasn't too sweet. The second pasta was gnocchi in a sage cream sauce, also good. The third pasta was supposed to be linguine in a mushroom sauce, but the noodles were extremely under-cooked, some of them still clumped together at one end, and there wasn't any sauce in the pan. Even the server commented on the lack of a sauce. It was inedible..Again, our waitress was gone for a long time and one of the nearby servers noticed that we weren't eating our meals and we were actively searching for our waitress. He came over to our table and we explained the situation. He was really nice and immediately went to find the manager to get it fixed. In the meantime, our waitress did stop by and we explained again to her. She also went to find the manager. The manager came over to our table almost immediately. She was very kind and apologetic, indicating they were having a very bad day in the kitchen. She offered us new plates of food, but at this point we weren't very hungry and still hadn't eaten dessert. The manager offered to pay for our meals and dessert. I had a Nutella tart and my husband had tiramisu, both yummy, but too large to finish.Before leaving, our waitress told us we should come back, especially after they had plans to remodel in the near future. Not sure that we will after this experience..."
"Very over priced for what we got. We got the pasta tasting menu. $35 a plate. No meat in any of the 3 pastas. Not very tasty. They were impressed with themselves that 2 of the 3 pastas were made onsite and other one was imported, but that doesn't matter at all if the dishes they include are not rich and tasty and creative. This was truly on par with Olive Garden all you can eat pasta for $11. Same all you can eat. Same not much meat or veggies included. Same small dessert. Same service. Not same price."
After watching Lidia's Kitchen I thought I'd try it even though I heard it was pricy. It was not Like The lidia's program on Wqed. I think Lidia &Grandma would be appalled! I had a salad with a red wine vinegar&EVOO dressing on request. Someone in kitchen in charge of salads don't know how to make a proper easy dressing! I am a retired Sous Chef 10 yrs retired at a resort hotel in Miami beach. So I was appalled by a lousy not fresh dirty salad! Yes dirty! The endive had the bottom cores on them and wasn't washed properly. The veggies tomatoes were gross and the dressing was mixed oil vinegar only no herbs! I pushed it away ugh! Then I had the gnocchi my Mom used to make from scratch ! This wasn't that! This was the frozen gnocchi I in supermarkets they were all the same size and the taste was that you find in a store not fresh made! Don't be fooled! It came w duck ragu that was ice cold! They must of forgot to heat it up. Desert time! Well I was still very hungry order coffee and Tiramisu was a old soggy mess! Last piece in fridge seemed like. I hate Olive garden but Lidia's made that good! Next time want Italian& nice prices go to Alexander's in Bloomfield all their pastas made to order in kitchen it says on their menu may take  10 extra minutes to prepare since they make them to order! Try their Calamari over Angel hair yum! Until Lidia's comes here and inspects & teaches that staff how to cook her recipes they are not what she makes on tv! I made her recipes and they were really great this was simply Gross& high priced too!& I went by Access so didn't have to pay $7.00 valet parking fee!
"This place is pretty poor and really needs to get it's act together because it's a disgraceful place to watch football, especially given the accessibility of technology these days.  First off, it is desperately in need of some updates.  There are old crappy projector screens and a few big rear projection TVs, but not an HDTV in sight.  There are TVs aplenty, but they just feel dinghy and outdated and the reception on every TV is snowy.The biggest issue, however, is that apparently they're only able to show 6 games at any 1 time throughout the huge bar area.  There are several main bar islands, booths, and pub tables all over with individual TV screens at each booth.  Sounds good, but what good are all these seats if you can only show 6 games?  That is absurd when you consider how huge Sports Rock is, especially during college football.  I went to watch a game that was on regular old ESPN, and they weren't showing the game.  You mean I could go to my hotel to watch the game but am unable to watch it at a ""sports bar""??  Give me a break.Food is also generally terrible.  Nachos are no better than what you can get at 7-11 and sandwiches have no flavor.  And service is piss poor and understaffed.  I'm not sure if they recently changed ownership or what, but something was very very off here and they were obviously unprepared for the start of the football season.I feel bad because the people were very nice and apologetic, but that does not take away from the fact that even if they were showing my game, I think I'd still rather watch it in my hotel room."
"I think that typically sports bars are really not expected to have good food.  They just need to have four things1. ESPN2. Nachos pilled high with all kinds of stuff3. beer specials4. big screen TVs.Well Sports Rock failed on all accounts.  I was encouraged when we walked in and saw individual TVs on each table.  Of course we picked the one that didn't work!  Then we realized while there were many out of market games, the Virginia Tech one was nowhere to be seen. So we politely ask for ESPN.  Not ESPN U or 360 or anything fancy.  Plain old regular ESPN.  Then we get some story about how they only have six recievers.  Thats fine.  But why am i watching the Maine/Iowa game.  SERIOUSLY.  I was also annoyed that when the cute girl walked up to the bar, he had the Georgia game on within minutes. The nachos were absolutely disgusting and my wrap just leaked oil and disgustingness.   The fries were even terrible, but i found if you dipped them in the gross nacho cheese, they weren' that bad.   Plus, beer was 4.75!  Multiply that by a 3 hour game and you're paying a lot.  Service was awful and i think i would get better reception on a tv with rabbit ears.  Overall this place sucked, although i will give them credit as we were finally getting up to leave and go to an Irish Bar that was able to show ESPN, i noticed the hokie game all the way back in the corner.  Took them long enough.If you're ever in Pittsburgh in need of watching ESPN heres my idea.  Grab a permanti brothers sandwich and a six pack of beer and watch it in your hotel room rather than waste your money to sit and watch Maine vs Iowa on a crappy little tv with no reception."
"After ordering from here my credit card number was stolen. Since this was the only place I had used it in a number of weeks, I can only assume it was stolen by someone here. Not a savvy business practice."
"Too oily , i felt like im eating pure fat , even the bread is covered with oil ! I suggest they make it healthier with more whole wheat option, grape leaves are very dry and tasteless. Oh and their fries are terrible"
"Came here on a Sunday, it was slow and we got our food in good time.Ordered two personal size pizzas, spicy fries, fried zucchini & onion rings. The pizzas were actually really good but the other sides weren't worth it. Tastes plain & over cooked. Ok so the reason why I'm giving this place 1 star is because I saw soooo many health code violations! * A RedBull can on the pizza dressing table.* The woman who charged me was working on a pizza and didn't even wash her hands after she charged me! She just went right back to working on making the pizza! * The same woman who charged me -NOT kidding ...her nails were long & yellow, mind you she wasn't wearing any gloves while putting that pizza together. YUCK!! * Same chick went out for a cigarette break (in the front of the place) and when she was coming back in she brought AND blew the smoke inside the restaurant. Price range in Yelp language is $$I definitely won't go back because if that's what I was able to witness in the front of the place, I don't want to imagine what's going on in the back!!! I don't think I'm being harsh. That was one too many violations in my opinion."
"Is sad because the pizza is great but the service is horrible! We place an order at 10:17 am for 2 extra large pizzas and 2 small. The girl said about 45 min to an 1 hr, great perfect timing in order to feed my staff at lunch when the girl repeated the phone number back I realized that this was the general number and asked if she could take my direct dial that way they would actually reach someone when the called to notify me that the delivery was in the lobby she repeated it back and I thought all was well. I called back at 12:29 and asked if my order had left yet and all I was asked was what was the address, ah hello we're in downtown and did you ever think there might be more than one order coming in from the same office bldg... A 3rd phone call was made closer to 1 pm to ask what was the hold up, only to find out that my order was attempted to be delivered around 11:30 am but they couldn't reach anyone so they left when asked what number they were trying they said the general number, yes the same number I advised the girl taking the order that she wouldn't reach anyone at. The manager offered to remake the order since it had been sitting and offered a $5 discount on my next order, wow thanks! So after about 30 minutes the order still wasn't here so we called yet again only to be told we're trying to call but no one is answering and that the driver was in the lobby. Needless to say they had all the right numbers but not in the correct order. Not only did we give them a direct dial at the beginning of the order,after all the confusion and speaking with the manager we then gave a cell number just to be sure the call wouldn't be missed. It seems the staff at Ephesus needs to take an effective listening class, maybe it'll help. When we told them this was the worst service we've ever received and that we would not be ordering again the simple response was ""ok"""
"Delivery: Horrible experience. We waited over 2 hours for the food to be delivered. The owner had no idea when the food was dispatched or when the food was made. She promptly explained that the internet was down. However, the grubhub notification indicated otherwise. The owner essentially lied about the delivery."
crooks they overcharge you on grubhub with increase price. stay away don't try these crooks. food is terrible so is customer service. there are better restaurants in pittsburgh. this is piss poor excuse for a turkish restaurant.
"I ordered 2 pizzas, a gyro and fries for a special recognition for one of my co-workers. we chose this restaurant because of the ratings and wanting to try something new. I ordered through grub hub. the order was to include a free cheesy bread and two-2 litre drinks. there was a spot to leave instructions. I asked that the pizzas be cut into squares (they show it this way in a photo) and for one of the drinks to be diet. After not receiving the food for 30 minutes past the promised time, I called. I spoke politely, asking when my food would be delivered and was hung up on. I called back in 15 minute increments (each time being given a different excuse) they could not get ahold of the driver, there was traffic. I explained that this was for a celebration and if they would just let me know so that if it wasn't coming I could order from another restaurant. They finally agreed to cancel the order. This was more than 2 hours after I had placed the order. As soon as I hung up the phone, the food was delivered. I did not receive the free cheesy bread and the drink order was incorrect. the pizza was not sliced into squares and I did not receive any French fries. I sent s message to grub hub and they said they talked to the establishment and there is nothing they can do about it. I would be careful ordering food here. The service was very poor."
I ordered the boneless wins with garlic sauce and they were terribly hard as well as salty. Delivery was fine but the food was terrible. Never ordering from them again.
"Okay, so I've heard a lot of good things about this place. And I wanted to like it!But it was seriously bad. I very rarely eat somewhere and don't finish my food simply because I don't like it. But I couldn't eat it. I got the Shadyside and it was super greasy, and the flavor just wasn't there. My roommate got the Portabella and she wasn't feelin' it either.The guy who served us was cool beans though."
"I received 2 hoagies (half-assed crap) from Peppi's in the Strip from my friends' daughters dance fundraiser just the other day.  I paid $6.50 each for SMALL 8"" or so - smushed bread, hardly any meat and wilted lettuce hoagies!!  Are you kidding me?!  What a rip off!!I have ordered hoagies from all over the place for these types of fundraiser functions as well as sold hoagies for years as a child. THESE HOAGIES ARE THE MOST PATHETIC hoagies I've ever seen or eaten!!  You should be Embarrassed and ashamed to even be selling these!!!  What a joke!!  I will NEVER be purchasing or eating from Peppi's ever again.  Horrible!"
"Good food worth waiting, and waiting, and waiting for...  Now wait & wait for the check."
"The absolute loudest hotel I've stayed at in a long LONG time. Paper thin wall,  poor booking practices ended us up in the middle of the most obnoxious wedding party ever. Drunk bride, hotel room parties until 3am, and an apparent lack of security to monitor anything going on in this hotel have lead to this rave early Saturday morning (and I do mean RAVE quite literally) review. And yes this was after the front desk was called several times with noise complaints. My best tip would be to not stay here unless the purpose of your stay is to not sleep."
"As our two day stay progresses, the rating drops.Building:  Impressive entry, great lobby.  Seems like a hotel of a bygone era.But...Valet is a mess.  Located on a two lane street with no pull-off, one must be lucky or patient to be able to pull up to the curb.  We came in on a busy Friday, but I knew it would be busy (it's a summer weekend) so why are there not more valets?As I returned both Friday and Saturday.  I had to park the car, exit and stand there, waiting for someone to take my keys.   Friday it was about five minutes. I had to make sure I locked it myself, since the valet simply came and took my keys and stuck them on the rack.  I had to point my car to him.  Didn't really trust what was happening among the chaos.  Saturday upon return.  There was no valet in sight.  I parked, exited, waited.. and waited and waited.  Finally a guy comes running across the street and nearly snatched the keys from my hand, as if I was keeping HIM from taking MY keys.  Check-in: I mingled in with a wedding party and other weekenders.  Again, a busy weekend (summer weekend and a wedding and Pirates in town) yet only two desks are working for check-in (the third was off with the wedding planner).  Took about 15 minutes to get to the desk and two minute check-in.   I understand the big wedding, but we're paying guests, too.The room was huge.  King bed, nice sized bathroom.  But very very cold.  No matter the setting, it remained freezing.If you request a river view be prepared and forewarned.  We were neither.  River view means stadium view and with a game going on, means lights, noise from departing crowed and that loud obnoxious so-called music from the plastic bucket-banging guy, the pirate Santa and some other keyboard playing dude, all trying to get a few bucks from the departing crowd... until well after 11 PM.Yes, for some 11 is not late.  However, we rise with the sun for work during the week, so we do the same all weekend.  Did I mention the noise from the ballroom right below us?  Party Friday night, wedding reception Saturday night.  At least Friday, the noise abated about 9 PM.  Saturday it's 10:32 and the party still thumping right below us.  (picture that annoying bass thumping car that you drive by, but instead it cruises right with you ... all night.)Couldn't really enjoy watching a movie, reading has been a challenge.Called desk manager who said the party was supposed to have ended at 10 P.M. and he was going to check on it.  Thirty minutes later, nothing.  He said he'd ""adjust our rate.""  He said he didn't understand our room placement and blamed ""being busy"" as a reason we were stuck in this room.  I understand there's an expected level of noise and light in a city, but had there been any indication of such, I'd have been sure to request a room on a higher floor and away from the river.  No notes on the room selection and not even a mention at check-in.  I guess being sold out, some guests get screwed.  Of course, by the time we figure it out, we can't request another room since we're in bed already and the hotel seems sold out soooo....Oh that wedding?  In the main lobby Saturday afternoon.  So that beautiful lobby that might have been a joy to sit in and read and enjoy a coffee?  Off limits.  Mostly, I""m annoyed by room selection.  A peaceful relaxing stay it isn't.    For the rate we are paying, I expected a much more comfortable and relaxing stay.  I will not stay here again. Beware and be warned.Update 8/29/15:  the reception ended at 11 P.M.  Night manager adjusted our rate and comped a day of valet.  Acceptable, but won't risk those issues again at the rate they charge"
The hotel is trying to claim a stain was found in the room and have charged my credit card $100.00 with no notification which I later found out they do have to send a notification to the customer. I called the General Manager who said he would call back in 24 hours. Ten days later I had to call him. Terrible service by the man who runs the hotel. I would never stay there again because of the lack of professionalism.
